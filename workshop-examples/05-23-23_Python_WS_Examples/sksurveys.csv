For these reasons if my family wasn't still in SK likely we would go to"
Danielson,Itâ€™s always an enjoyable weekend going out there and super close to where I live . I usually book on a Thursday /Friday and leave Friday to come out,A beach area for dogs . I go camping lots with them and some of the areas allow for a dog area on the beach specific for dogs on a leash or a lead line so itâ€™s easier to bring them back in from the water .,2018,I would really like to see a dog beach portion next year .

It would be lovely if there was a way that a person could book a site and be able to override a reservation if they are booking it for a longer period of time. Especially if the booking that is being overridden is a one night booking.

Saskatchewan Landing,Although the park is crazy beautiful... we take a lot of things to the beach when we go with the kids. The parking was quite far away in order for us to carry everything we wanted to bring. I understand not wanting the parking lot so close but even a drive up/drop off point would be great to incorporate.,Culvert firepits,2018,Yes - you NEED to get rid of those tall BBQ firepits - they are not good for sitting around and visiting and enjoying a night around the fire.  It honestly affects my decision as to what park to go to... and one of the reasons we love Jackfish so much!

Good Spirit,Staff at the check in were very  pleasant,,2018,Most of the campsites need to be leveled and the grills over the fireplace are crocked and need to be replaced. We like to cook over the fire and it makes it hard to do with the grills so uneven.
Duck Mountain,Private camp site.    (Plenty of) Clean showers.   Lovely sandy beaches.   Hiking trails.   Childrenâ€™s activities.,,2018,
Great Blue,We liked the lake,,2018,
Duck Mountain,"We did not require a park map when we arrived - to find out later that attached to the map were 2 more pieces of information about camping with bears in the area.  This should have been handed out to EVERY person coming into the gates.  There were sightings of the bear when we were there, but were not notified by any staff - although friends that were camping at the same time had a Park Staff person come around to their site, as well as mention that a Conservation Officer would be around later.  We had neit",,2018,"We love our camping at Douglas Park.  Each year at registration time, we always stress because the reservation system decides if we camp that year or not!  If we are unfortunate to be dealt with a larger que number, we might not find a site that suits our time-frame during the summer months.  As a 20+ year camper at the park, that would be heartbreaking!"
Great Blue,The beach and ammenities are great for children.,,2018,"Id love to see some tent sites. Meaning natural ground, not gravel. I love tents and natural ground is better for tents."
Danielson,Everything went well..no complaints,,2018,No
Meadow Lake,Everything was what expected to be,,2018,
Good Spirit,"The weather was perfect, no storms.  Outdoor bathroom was fairly clean and only ran out of hand santizer once.  Indoor bathroom was fairly clean.  Was able to spend some quite time and enjoy the look out point.  One night there was no water and people kept on using the bathroom, there really was no other choice.",Hotter water in the laundry area.,2018,It is close so one can escape the City and be sitting in your lawn chair knowing this peacefulness has been what you were craving since the last camping trip last year.  It is a time that I can regroup.
Meadow Lake,We enjoy the group camping site,Have a larger group firepit in the middle for everyone to sit at like at the Jackfish provincial Park,2018,
Cypress Hills,"My husband and I have been camping at this park since we were kids. We love that SaskParks continues to make improvements to this park. The sites are beautifully treed, the park is great for kids, and although the boat launch can be over full on a beautiful day, it is a nice part of the facilities.",,2018,

Duck Mountain,was all good,yurts,2018,
Greenwater,The weather wasn't the greatest but that is not the fault of the park.  There were too many yappy little dogs.  We've been going to Murray Point for six years and love the park; the sites are fairly secluded and quite large.  It's the reservation system that's a pain.  The main bathrooms and showers are great but the others are in terrible shape and need repair or replacing.,,2018,I still feel that people who reside in Saskatchewan should got first choice for campsites regardless of which one it is.  After all it is their tax dollars that help support the Provincial Parks.
Crooked Lake,Full service would be preferred.  Minowukaw beach needed to be raked/debris cleaned up,Fully serviced sites,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,Staff were friendly.  Bathrooms are in great shape and clean!,full service sites or more sewage dumps,2018,The Battlefords Provincial Park needs new shower facilities in the south campground.
Lac La,Friendly staff. Beautiful weather! Poplar ridge needs more trees. Roads are rough,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,We have been coming to Rowan's for years. Just love it,,2018,
Pike Lake,I am very disappointed that it is so hard to get a seasonal campsite or weekly good campsite but the camp office staff use 2 of the most popular campsite spots and than keep another one for management use.  I have no troubles with them getting use of a site but feel it should be one of the unpopular sites.,,2018,They have done a lot of upgrades that were well done and appreciated shower house and boat parking lot.  The staff put a lot of work into making sure there are lots of activities and we have really enjoyed them.
Lac La,.,,2018,The beach area was terrible - the sand itself was OK but the grass was literally covered in duck/goose poop.  It was impossible to walk without stepping in the poop.  This was a problem the entire week we were there; it was not ever good.  Super disappointing.
Good Spirit,The camp area was clean and the washrooms were very nice. The hot water for the showers was a problem and the  park was well site out.,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,"Our site was easily accessible , fire wood available close to the water.Liked the craft sale and market place on Saturday",More full service sites,2018,
Duck Mountain,"Have camped in this park since all my life. Happy with the upgrades to electrical sites, additional sites added, additional shower houses. Disappointed to not have the seasonal site option at a reduced rate like we have had in the past. Disappointed last season to not have been able to get a site booked because sites were all booked before I could get through online booking. AND, of course, disappointed in how much it costs to go camping these days. It used to be a  poor man's  holiday. Not the case anymore",,2018,"Firewood at Douglas was very dirty as apposed to what other people have experienced in other Sask Prov Parks. Would be nice if they could  get firewood loaded and delivered without bringing all that dirt with it. Having said that, I am happy to have access to the firewood that you do offer."
Rowans Ravine,There is no interacting with park staff with the current system of booking and checking in. The bathroom cleanliness has always been a issue,,2018,Do not agree with the reservation and cancellation fees. On line reservation to start the season has always been difficult to get the sites desired.

Narrow Hills,"We have been there many times before. We have family there and near-by. We like to golf, with three courses close at hand. They have some of the nicest campsites that you will find. We try to get full service sites, but that is very difficult most years, unless you are early in the queing line.",,2018,We would like to see more full service sites at more of the Provincial Park campgrounds.
Makwa,We stay at Nemeiben Lake campground.  The campground employees there are excellent to deal with (Shirley and John).  The water service technician (Shane) does an impeccable job on the water system.,Seasonal sites at Nemeiben Lake campground,2018,"Yes, the highway from LaRonge to Nemeiben Lake turnoff is in really bad shape. The patch jobs they do don't last for very long.  There are many heaves and potholes in the highway which can be very dangerous.      For the last 35 years, we've booked a site at Nemeiben Lake for the entire season and it would be nice if we could get a seasonal rate on our campsite.  Wadin Bay and Nut Point have them, so I don't know why Nemeiben can't.      As I mentioned earlier in this survey, the campground employees are ve"

Meadow Lake,My family has been meeting here every year for 40 years. I was happy this year because there werenâ€™t as many boats and large units camping there,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,There were many dogs running around off leash and one ran after my dog which led to my wife spraining her ankle. Also the campsite beside the showers which suspiciously has the same seasonal spot every year had no regard for the rules. They over the amount of tents over the amount of people and generally no had no regard for the rules,Please more trails and possibly an off leash area,2018,More trails are desperately needed. The park is quite boring if you do not have a boat.
Battlefords,always love camping here. Nothing to complain about,,2018,
Rowans Ravine,The park could do with a little more routine maintenance.,"Full service in more sites, more options for long term camping.",2018,"Sites available for booking longer than two weeks should not be bookable for less than two weeks, so that if you don't get a seasonal site you don't have to compete with weekend campers for available campsites."
Douglas Provincial,Because they have a disc golf course,More Disc Golf Courses that utilize the natural landscape,2018,
Great Blue,"Could have used more trees in our area, but overall it was really nice.",Horse riding trails,2018,"I wish the fees to camp were free and if people don't show up, then they have to pay the penalty fees.  Daily rates of $25-30/night is getting expensive and a family might as well rent a cabin or go to a hotel (with waterslides) once you factor in all the camping trailers and gear, it's getting too expensive and I think the next generation is going to dwindle out or not be able to afford going camping."
Good Spirit,"sites are nice, good wood. all playgrounds are the same - kind of boring in that respect.",,2018,
Duck Mountain,The park is in a nice location by the lake with the little store. Sites are maintained and treed well. I don't like the pedestal firepits though - not safe - logs roll out!,"wood delivery, ice delivery, bike sharing",2018,The fees are pretty high and it's really hard to plan and reserve multiple sites for groups on long weekends.
Saskatchewan Landing,"The only issues I have with this park is the sewage dump. there is only one dump and it is lined up at the end of every weekend. People drive in from the other side and fights have started because of this. There needs to be some signage to show one way only, and no entry from the other side.",,2018,
22,The park and beach were un kept and the bathrooms by our group sight and other stays were disgustingly dirty and even after we asked a worker they were still unkept,More entertainment for families,2018,

Rowans Ravine,it was good.  Had some power issues but they resolved them.,,2018,
Danielson,we really enjoy the park,,2018,I think you need to make the reservation system able to make multiple reservations easier.  i book for 2 other family members each year and it is difficult to pay for them and  not get dumped out of the system
Blackstrap Provincial,Water main break. I had an infant with me and there was no compensation for this. Had to leave early,,2018,
Duck Mountain,The park was beautifully maintained and clean. Park staff were very friendly.,,2018,"We were disappointed this year in the park maintenance at Saskatchewan Landing. The individual sites as well as the park as a whole was not as clean or clear of debris as it has been in previous years. Bathrooms were not cleaned or stocked with supplies as frequently, fire pits were full of ash, lots of dead tree branches within trees and on the ground, and garbage on the beach."
Good Spirit,Poor maintenance.,"Small store, boat recreation rentals",2018,
Crooked Lake,It was cold,,2018,
Moose Mountain,I like the more laid back vibe at the provincial parks compared to national parks.,,2018,"Iâ€™d like to see tent-only areas. RVs tend to dominate the campgrounds and ruin the experience. I hate going to a more â€œrusticâ€ non-electric campground only to be surrounded by generator noise and fumes constantly. Not much of an escape from civilization at that point, and itâ€™s counterproductive to conservation efforts."
Good Spirit,Great location and nice treed sites,,2018,No

Lac La,"weel kept, good camp sites, good trails and facilities",,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,everything went well,,2018,the road to rowans ravine is getting better but still needs improvement all the way to the park
Pike Lake,It was a beautiful place to camp. However we experienced power outages & couldnâ€™t use the brand new washroom/shower facilities for a period of time. Also the cleaning schedule was during the morning when I wanted to shower,Full service sites...,2018,We would like to consider a seasonal site at Pike Lake but the seasonal sites are the worst of the entire campground. Also there are too many double sites at Pike Lake. The online reservation system doesnâ€™t work well with having a random place in line as by the time I got through all the good spots were taken. I then spent a whole lot more to change my reservation afterwards
Duck Mountain,To many ppl wandering around  to feel that my things were safe,,2018,

Duck Mountain,"Wonderful park, beautiful sites, nice beach",,2018,Would be nice to update the fire pits. Some are very old and bent so it is hard to cook on them.
Moose Mountain,"We have been going to Kimbal Lake for 18 years,  we have always enjoyed it.",Better reservation system. Too many empty sites,2018,We tried to book the group campsite first 2 weeks of July but were not successful.  We had individual sites and the group site sat empty for a week.  When we first started going there the campsites were always full.  There was a change in reservation system and the last few years there are always empty campsites not being used.
Great Blue,We love having our own space and not being able to see your neighbors. We also like the campground and amenities like mini golf and ice cream parlor.,,2018,
Greenwater,The boat dock was terrible. Worse every year. We have been coming to this park for twenty plus years and every year the dock is in worse shape than the year before. Also we found the toilet facilities in worse shape and badly in need of repair. Add to that the noisy parties that were a nightly occurance and spoiled our quiet evenings.,Improved docking facilities,2018,People are not cleaning up after their pets. All kinds of dog poop at the dock and parking lot. Disgusting!
Narrow Hills,We had wanted to stay longer but on the online site it said the park was full but there were numerous sites that were empty!!,,2018,
Rowans Ravine,The pool is wonderful.  Inexpensive and very clean and well kept.  The campsite however are so baron in the pull thru sites.  It feels like you are on show for everyone who drives buy.  I saw trees that were planted but it will be a long time before they will give any privacy.,,2018,Most of the parks we attended were wonderful.  Whoever developed the Battlefords provicial park needs to help out Pike Lake.  Some parts of the campground people are stacked on to of each other like a refugee camp.  The pull thru sites are like you are on display.
Good Spirit,It is. A great park,,2018,
Crooked Lake,No Confectionery inside the area or campsite like PikeLake. And not so much to do to play for the kids.,Confectionery in every Provincial park that has great foods and stuff like for camping. Fishing area and canoeing. More recreations for kids.,2018,Maintenance of all Shower and washrooms cleanliness and more playground for kids and nice Firepits
Great Blue,Thereâ€™s no water hook up at sites which is not convenient.. thereâ€™s no garbage containers close anywhere?? You have to bike or drive to far bins by dump even to take dog doody bags.. the amount of bird crap on beach is quite sad. The store right by the beach has really awful people working it .. this was not the most enjoyable trip,,2018,"It feels like camping is getting more and more expensive but you get less .. not very good sites. So very little full service that you can not even book one and it costs a fortune if you can. Cleanliness is down, friendly people working is down."
Duck Mountain,It's a beautiful park and nice to see all the work being down to return it to its full potential.  We LOVED it.  The only issue we had was some difficulty getting our toy hauler to the site we booked which was deemed open or a unit of our size.  And the lack of accessible water taps was bit tricky but thankful there is a  water guy,"More access to rentals such as kayaks and paddle boards, and better hiking trail signage",2018,We are lucky to have access to so many beautiful parks.  We book approx 30-45 nights. per year at a few campgrounds and still have issues with the online system in getting sites to accommodate our toy hauler.  And yet when we get to campground we see small units or tents in large sites.  I also would suggest a system that allows people to pay a premium to not have to move sites because they can only get a few days in each or to guests to pay bit less if they are willing to relocate in order to accommodate a
Pike Lake,Overall love the park.  Firewood was poor though. Wet and full of old fence posts.,,2018,"Find it disappointing that a number of prime camp sites in the park are used by staff or are reserved as  Management Site .  The  management site  was never available.  The staff sites are prime locations and this seems like an abuse of the system/intent.    Also, the penalty for now shows needs to be increased.  Many sites become available too late after a no show to allow for people wanting to camp.  For example a week reservation starting on Friday can no show for only a one night penalty but the site co"
Duck Mountain,"We have spent time camping across the country and Saskatchewan is one of the best values out there.

This feature has actually caused us on many an occasion to stay in the province at one of our provincial parks rather than travel elsewhere.
Danielson,"The park and the services are great, the park is beautiful. We return here year after year. This year a camper near to us complained about us because we were too noisy and dinner time. There were family in the cabins and hotel as well as other camp sites, we were very careful to be quiet at night. We were not the only campers that had complaints lodged against them, it was obvious the complainers were the problem campers. There has to be a better way to handle complaints, maybe we should have been able to t",,2018,
Lac La,"Greenwater has recurrent negative issues for campers, particularly those staying in Aspen. However, our family does enjoy the overall camping experience in this park.",Tent ONLY areas; make Aspen so. Dust control on gravel roads. Restrict LARGE trailers in Aspen. Improve ground conditions in Aspen.,2018,"Greenwater Park has a consistent negative approach to those who wish to tent only. Few pads are specifically designed to facilitate tenting and most of those are in Aspen. Angular gravel is spread (not evenly!) on each pad and this damages tent bottoms; these pads need a layer of sand and they need to be leveled. This park has allowed substantial parts of its roads to revert to gravel, and dust is a severe problem, particularly near Aspen. Although the pads at Aspen are small, the Park allows HUGE trailers"

Didn't like the new dividers that have been installed between some of the double sites, as this is one of the main reasons we come to Pike, was good for a small family get together.

22,Nice group site that accommodated our large group very easily.  Not far to the beach.  Was easy to book.,,2018,Disappointed that we were not able to book a group site for 2019 before we left because they are doing a computer upgrade.  This is an annual trip for extended family that we would hate to miss.
Duck Mountain,The site was clean as were the washrooms. Did have some neighbors that left food around their campsite even though there was a bear warning in effect.,,2018,"When we arrived, even though we knew about the bear advisory (friends that were there let us know) we were not advised when we entered the park nor were we provided with any literature. If there is an advisory, then this should be mandatory for everyone entering the park."
Moose Mountain,Wonderful area.  Camped with fine people.  Great cycling trails.  Clean water.    Campground needs maintenance.  Poorly maintained.  Vegetation is taking over campsites. Grass is long.  Bathrooms are pit toilets and need replacing.  Doors don't lock.,,2018,Just that maintenance at Kimball Lake campground and group campground needs drastic improvement.
Battlefords,We wanted to go earlier but our camp site was booked. When we checked in we found out the sight had been empty for three days . We were dissapointed there was no way of notification to let us know.,,2018,
Candle Lake,Nice campground. Should have an off leash dog park area. Also charging a fee when you add a day to your stay online is totally ridiculous especially when you are charging for every single reservation you make over the summer,Off leash dog parks,2018,"When you sign up for an online account one the of perks should be that you donâ€™t pay a fee to change a reservation that you have Already paid a fee to make. I was charged to add a day on to my stay when I already paid $15 to make the reservation.     Also, I have so many say that provincial parks need off leash dog areas.     Enjoyed our stay at the parks this year overall!"
Duck Mountain,Great camping spot. Park staff are awesome.,Recycling bins,2018,The reservation system is totally inadequate. Finding a campsite for a 2 week period proved to be almost impossible even when we were #2 off the random list. This was because people snatched up the weekends leaving the week days open. Perhaps the park officials could designate one loop of sites for short term (weekenders) only leaving the other sites for longer stays.

I always camp at Kimball Lake and would love to see the trails maintained as well as the beach. The amount of alcohol on the beach was insane as well as dogs on the beach. It would be nice to see the ranger or COâ€™s patrolling the beaches like they have in years past. There are rules for a reason.

Danielson,We could not get the site (sites) we wanted and ended up in overflow.  There were lots of empty sites but it said they were reserved.,Checking license plates to make sure people are not in sites for longer than the maximum stay.  You don't mind moving every 14 days if you know that others are doing it too.  It is frustrating moving when you know people are staying in sites for 30 days.,2018,
Danielson,"Hard to find, poor mapping available online, bathrooms in terrible condition",,2018,
Duck Mountain,Site was very open and small. Pictures of the site in the booking system did not accurately reflect the site,,2018,Stricter rules need to be put in place for families with excessive tents and excessive people per site.

Other years when we try to get into the regular site as a group of 2 or 3 campers it is impossible to book together.  This park has high usage and I am strongly against the provincial parks awarding annual sites to people.  There are too many of them and they take away from the people who just want to access the park occasionally.  I realize it is probably about the money, but"
Candle Lake,Great site for a reasonable price.  Lots of things to do that were close and convenient,,2018,
Douglas Provincial,There was a fire ban when we were there. The boat dock is in need of repair. If it were a work site it would be a safety factor. The roads in the park are full of holes. It looks like a under maintained park. The park need signage for proper parking at the boat launch.,12:00 pm check out is to early. Used to be 2:00 pm,2018,The boat launch at Echo has had a dock sitting on the ground for years. Put the dock in or hire someone to control the boat traffic. Trim the tree going to the Echo boat dock. Have the beach users park in the parking lot away from the boat trailer lot.

Saskatchewan Landing,"The poor (but improved since last year) state of the access road from Bulyea really puts a damper on the camping or day trip visits to Rowan's Ravine.

The washroom facilities at Good Spirit are in need of replacement. The facilities at Rowan's Ravine"
Buffalo Pound,"Sites are nice and lots of room if you camp up top. There's isn't much parking by the beach, so people tend to fill it up with their boat trailers.

Saskatchewan Landing,It is a great camp ground and it suites our family well on our drive from Alberta to Northren Ontario.,,2018,We love stopping at Rowanâ€™s ravine on our trip from Alberta to northern Ontario and have stopped for a number of years on our way. This year we found the road from craven to the park pretty rough and we lost a light on the road due to the rough terrain. A new pavement is badly needed. We decided to stay somewhere else on our way back to Alberta because the road was so bad. We hope that this is fixed or on its way to being fixed on our next trip out that way.

Danielson,x,,2018,x
Pike Lake,Beautiful park and helpful workers,,2018,Saskatchewan Provincial parks are beautiful but the roads to get to some of them are horrible and not taken care of they should all be paved and smooth.

We have a boat the boat launch could be better (deeper on all sides of the dock) the bathroom and showers were great - the sewer dump the apron around could be leveller it hard to get a complete dump.,,2018,I really liked the shower curtains at cypress hills  wish Douglas would get them.    The showers at Douglas could use a up date the showers at cypress were so  much cleaner brighter the shower curtain fit the showers keeping the floors dry.  The boat launch at Douglas needs to be deepened getting tired of having to drive to Elbow to launch  Buffalo could use a hand wash station at the sewer dump Douglas and  Buffalo could use new flush hoses with the end on so we could use a wand in the toilet  we love camp

Great Blue,"Site was clean, good wood for fires, quiet campground, great facilities",Multiple site bookings for the same dates so that friends could camp together - perhaps limit to two sites per person per booking,2018,Our parks are a jewel for the province.

Great Blue,Nice clean park. Just wish for more electrical sites as I can never get one!,,2018,The book on line reservation system is great but the extra fee for using it makes no sense as you arenâ€™t paying a staff to book the site for me I am doing it myself. A couple dollars would be ok but the amount charged is too much especially when we were making multiple bookings
Danielson,Not necessarily the visit.  It was difficult to get a spot.  When we were there there were empty spots.  I think people abuse the system.  The park isnâ€™t as clean as it used to be.  Weâ€™ve been going for 25 years.,,2018,Booking system needs some serious attention.  People who book and the donâ€™t show up but donâ€™t cancel.  I know the park is still getting their money but someone could enjoy that site.  I can see 1 night but an entire weekend?

Great Blue,"Good Spirit Lake is a wonderful area and the campground sites are good. However, the washroom facilities are deplorable, absolutely awful. No flush toilets!

The on-line registration system was very good, better than Alberta's that we used in 2018."
Moose Mountain,the site and amenities were exactly what we expected as we have camped in this area  for the past several years,,2018,we really prefer to have the lakeside site but would like to have them electrified
Duck Mountain,The fact that campers are not allowed to have a mini fridge under the canopy of the camping unit is disconcerning due to the evolution of the camping units,,2018,"With the evolving camping units and camping in general I don't see why mini fridges are not allowed under the units canopy.   If you're allowed to bring a bbq from home, why not a mini fridge????"
Greenwater,The staff is just great. They are so helpful and so friendly. They work really hard to keep the campers happy and comfortable.,Clothes washer and dryers would be helpful,2018,Staff handled several challenging situations at Murray Point on Emma Lake very well. Kudos to all.
Rowans Ravine,there was an abundance of firewood and campground was quieter than in previous years,,2018,Booking online was very disappointing.  People from other provinces got sites and I was number 1200 in the queue and couldn't get anything I wanted and this has happened for the last 3 years.  Like to understand how families can booked joined sites when others can't even get any sites.  Something has to be done to make it fair to everyone to book a site
Moose Mountain,Campsite wasn't cleaned up before arrival and wood was very hard to light.,,2018,
Moose Mountain,Was told there was no sites avalible (1-80) but when I was there there were sites open.,,2018,
Duck Mountain,Had a great time.  Just wish the boat launch was better.   And didnâ€™t like having to move after two weeks because someone had it booked for the weekend when we were wanting to camp longer,,2018,It would be nice to have some sites where you could park your camper and leave it year round.
Duck Mountain,"It is a nice park, well maintained. The only issue is there was bear warnings, so I was surprised to see the garbage cans were not bear safe.",Bear safe garbage units,2018,Get bear safe garbage cans before some poor bear gets put down just because he was attracted to the garbage left out.
Greenwater,"It's beautiful there and our site was nice and private.  The amenities were good, too.",Wi-Fi,2018,"The only issue I would like addressed, was not finding out about a fire ban at Buffalo Pound until I was at the park, yet the ban had been in place the whole week prior to us arriving. I checked online before going and there was nothing online to advise of the fire ban either. We would've appreciated the chance to book at a different park where there was no fire ban in place."

Pike Lake,Overall a good experience nice size spots,,2018,
Cypress Hills,Quiet location.   Well kept park.,,2018,"There is a real lack of rule enforcement in provincial parks.   Our family enjoys the relaxation and peace of getting away from city life by enjoying a camping trip....   At least we used to.    It seems as though it is more about large gatherings, noisy parties, loud stereos and general disrespect for those around you.   We are beginning to consider selling our camping equipment and finding other activities to partake in as provincial park camping is increasingly an exercise in frustrations brought about b"
Blackstrap Provincial,"No water was available, due to damaged or frozen water lines.",,2018,"On the question about ads: the ads didn't affect my decision to camp at a provincial park. I had already made that decision. However, the ad inspired me to act on that decision and make a booking."
Duck Mountain,Clean site. Free fire wood. Not to busy.,,2018,Needs more full service sites
Narrow Hills,one of the best parks for the sites being private,better marked and maintained trails,2018,booking at the moose mountain park in Sept was not user friendly as most of the park was off limits
Pike Lake,Easy access to a quality site with no prior booking,Winter camping yurts,2018,Only wouldnâ€™t use the set up camping tents because we have a tent trailer. They are a good idea. Bravo. Make more winter camping oportunities available. More shower facilities are always appreciated.
Great Blue,"The sites were a nice size, easy to park in, private. The weather was nice (not that you can take credit for that, but it helps). We enjoying the beach, the hike, and the mini-golf.",,2018,I wish we lived closer and could come more often!
Greenwater,The campground and facilities are very well kept and clean. Friendly staff,,2018,
Moose Mountain,"beautiful park, have camped there every summer for 40+ years, sandy beach campground is quiet, not crowded, with nice private sites, the beach and lake are unbeatable.",,2018,"The fairy house gps walk was great. We can back and did it a 2nd time with friends.  Disappointed with the snack shack compared to previous years. Hours were variable and unpredicatable, hot food selections are not as good as other years."
22,We had 4 separate campsites booked.  Attempted to keep them as close together   as we could.  The map and site numbers showed they were.  However upon arrival one campsite was almost a kilometer away from the others,,2018,The campsites were originally created for tents many years ago and that worked.   Now campers and fifth wheel trailers are assigned those same sites which makes it very difficult to park in the small space.  Once the camper is parked and you park your truck in the site there is barely room for the picnic table.  Very cramped quarters
Good Spirit,Had nice spot,,2018,
Narrow Hills,Everything was as expected,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,Nice campground very well kept. Clean facilities,Amphitheater,2018,I wish there was more full service sites.

There was no noisy people nearby, and it was nice to go for a quiet morning walk down to the lake.",More natural wooded decent length hikes.,2018,"Battleford provincial park had unreasonably cold showers. I get that you are trying to save money, but it was extremely unpleasant, especially on the day when it was cool and raining a bit.  It was one thing if it just bugged me, but even my husband and sons who are super hot blooded and take cool showers regularly in the summer were upset about it. It doen't just hurry us out, it makes us think twice about booking there. Otherwise the park was very nice, though will need some more shade trees planted by th"

Candle Lake,"Came in the back way and was a complete nightmare trying to find where to check on there were no signs what so ever, upon check in the guy working wasnâ€™t that nice, plus the beach was awful, there was poop everywhere and smelt funny",,2018,
Greenwater,Our family loves camping at Emma Lake. The only negative comment I could make is the big red garbage bins inside the camping Isles. We experienced foul odors drifting into our site from the garbage bins unfortunately!! We were very satisfied with our site but would never book that one again simply for that reason. Sask Parks needs to designate an area for garbage bins!! They should not be placed close to campsites as it is not only Un-Attractive but can also draw in Bears & other unwanted wild animals!! Sas,Designated garbage bin area/zone,2018,Another great year of Sask Provincial camping!!
Candle Lake,Booked campground to hopefully use the pool if the weather was nice but the pool closed for the season before we arrived. Hopefully the park will be able to fix in the near future,,2018,
Greenwater,it was quiet and a good size,,2018,
Battlefords,We had a lovely time,,2018,
Douglas Provincial,Nice sites. Good fishing. Nearby amenities.,Disabled assessable boat launch.,2018,"Too much competition for sites online and too risky to just show up and hope for a decent site, especially with children."
Cypress Hills,Campsites are Fantastic   Washrooms modern and kept very clean  Beach area very disappointing.... Not maintained at all.,,2018,
Narrow Hills,The site was quite uneven. It was hard to park the camper.,,2018,
Lac La,Our site was spacious enough for our camper and boat.  The weather was beautiful and the boating was fantastic!,,2018,
Meadow Lake,"Have been there many times.  Weather was good, camp spot big, had family around to make it special.",Level the lots a few times a year.  Weather make ruts happen and noo one fixes their own ruts when they leave.,2018,
Duck Mountain,"Love the campground! Clean, water is awesome and the store staff are so friendly!",,2018,Fix the reservation system!!!  So many empty campsites when it says the campground is booked!  Stop allowing ppl to ruin other people's summer who want to camp but can't get a site because it's booked up when it clearly is not!!
Candle Lake,The fire ban made the camping experience much less fun,A posted notice of boat ramp rules and etiquette for using the boat ramp,2018,I believe dogs should not be allowed in Provincial park camp grounds. At the very least the  On leash  policy should be strictly enforced and owners who are caught not cleaning up after there dogs or keeping them on a leash should be removed or banned .A policy of no refunds on fees for being removed from campsite for breaches of pet issues as well as other breaches of rules is fair IMO
Douglas Provincial,"Most everybody in the park were respectful, polite people. The park is clean and well managed. Access to Gardiner Dam, the beach and cotteau bay close by are a bonus","Groceries stores, in park activities",2018,"Was kicked out of on-line reserve a site system after following all the rules and time frames, not sure why but the time I got back through system I did not get the camp sites or the preferred time"
Battlefords,The park needs a lot of clean up. Sites we were in had been left quite messy,More parking areas   More kids activities ie ball diamond bmx trail,2018,Our first visit of the year was in June and we had an interaction with a new conservation officer who was quite rude and on a power trip. This left quite a sour taste in my mouth
Great Blue,Wanted full service annual but fees to expensive only Albertians can afford. Just like our jobs and this government contracts to alberta buddies only.,Ful service more long stay spots,2018,
Moose Mountain,The bathrooms ran out of toilet paper by noon. It was ridiculous. That is not acceptable. What would people in tents do. I took my own toilet paper so I would have some.,"Toilets that have toilet paper. It wasnâ€™t even busy, there was no excuse.",2018,Completely unacceptable about bathrooms. Also beaches were very disgusting and never raked. Full of bird poop.
Danielson,The weather was gtreat and that is a very well maintained beautiful park.,,2018,No
Crooked Lake,We stayed at sandy bay for the first time (we usually stay at minowaka) the campsite was large enough for camper tent boat and both vehicles. Also good amount of easy parking after launching the boat. And lots of room to turn around,More activities and rentals ie kayaks/canoes,2018,We had a great long weekend. We usually camp up to 3-4 weeks at Sk parks. This year we went to the far north- lake Athabaska so our camping down south was shorter. We will see u next summer
Moose Mountain,there is always room to improve campsites and parks,,2018,
Crooked Lake,Beautiful campground and surroundings,,2018,
Douglas Provincial,I like the oark,,2018,
Candle Lake,"No swimming pool, had a boil water advisory and then hit us with a fire ban",More swings and other play structures,2018,Fix the pool at buffalo pound
Crooked Lake,Poor weather,Full service campsites,2018,
Danielson,Our site was exactly as pictured.  The site was clean and the fire pit had been emptied.  The bathrooms were very clean and in good working order.  There was lots and lots to do. The bike trails were well kept.  We saw lots of wildlife including a moose up close!  The staff everywhere were very curteous as were the other campers.  It was very quiet for the first 4 days.  We left early as the long weekend was starting and it got too busy and loud for our taste.,A dishwashing area,2018,
Danielson,"We enjoy our time in Cypress. Things seem to have improved with more consistency in rules and policies being obeyed/enforced, even during a fire ban!  That made it very enjoyable, knowing that the same rules applied to everyone. That wasn't always the case. What I haven't enjoyed is the unisex washrooms. Sometimes they are a complete mess from men using the facilities and I don't like to have to stand in urine and drop my pants to use the toilet. Obviously this was a frequent reminder.  Staff keep the washr",,2018,"We have been camping for decades in Cypress Hills and in 2018 we have seen general operational improvements overall. It is apparent that management and staff truly care about the facilities, the park, and the visitor experience. There seems to be a consistent delivery in management and services. I did not see any Conservation Officers this year, but I didn't need to. Everything was smooth and everyone seemed to be obeying the rules. Job well done by all. The swimming pool facility in Cypress Hills is in bad"
Crooked Lake,Would have chosen completely satisfied if the big hole in our campsite that was filled with water had been filled.,Baby swing at the playground,2018,Highway 224  in Meadow Lake Park is terrible. Until that is fixed we will not return to this park.
Candle Lake,Hiking on nicholls flats/ trans canada dyke trail as well as on the bike trails was awesome,,2018,Maintenance of trails as well as availabilty of non electric private (treed in) sites is one of our most highly valued aspects of the experience in Sask Parks. We Hope that as sask parks moves to upgrading sites to electric through the province they keep some sites non electric for those that still like the non electric experience!
Moose Mountain,I didnâ€™t like that I couldnâ€™t book longer. On reservation system said sites were booked and they remained open.,,2018,I donâ€™t like the online booking! Unless you are on the first day you donâ€™t get a site. Saskatchewan residents should get a week prior to other provinces.
Danielson,"We decided to try Cypress Hills Park after the Labour Dat weekend to avoid crowds. Not a great time to go. The office closed at 5pm so we had to pick a campsite as the sign indicated. The spaces provided for late checkin were not really ideal. The next day we discovered that nothing was open - the visitor centre, the canoe/kayak rentals, the dining room in the lodge - they were all closed on the second weekend of September! We understand that students make up the majority of manpower in provincial parks in",Stay open longer in the fall. Our parks should be available for use beyond May to the first weekend of September.,2018,
Moose Mountain,We love it there always have a great time at meadow lake,,2018,I don't like the online booking system too many empty lots. Too many people moving sites to stay longer. Needs a different system for booking.
Good Spirit,Because it was beautiful and the weather was great. Spending time with family and friends.,,2018,
Blackstrap Provincial,New spot was great. Service centre and playground brand new.,,2018,No
Douglas Provincial,Not as nice as Douglas or sasklanding,A real boat launch in Douglas park and expand the park as it is a very hard park to reserve,2018,You. Red a boat launch at Douglas park.  You need to expand Douglas park as itâ€™s very hard to reserve a site there.  You need to move the main beach to the current old boat launch area.  The bathrooms need to be cleaner.  You need to focus on more maintaince in Douglas park. Painting sign poles. Fixing the road inside the park as our 60000 trailer bottoms out every time we pull in and pull out of the loops that we stay in.  Garbage collection. This year we had a bear in Douglas park all summer ! We work i

Danielson,Always happy camping in this park! Clean and friendly staff,,2018,
Battlefords,fire pit was not cleaned out all summer,,2018,no
Duck Mountain,We have been camping at Douglas for 15+ years.  We love it.,,2018,I feel that the reservations should be open early to saskatchewan residents first. We pay taxes that support the parks.
Saskatchewan Landing,Facilities were great,,2018,No
22,"The group campsite is not clearly marked and we have numerous people coming through the campsite, on the swing and using the bathrooms also.  We do not feel completely safe at times as we have young children in our group.",,2018,Maybe have the staff mention to people registering about group campsites that it is off limits.
Moose Mountain,"Beautiful lake, clean water. It's my favorite place",,2018,
Moose Mountain,The site we had had a significant slope and was very difficult to park our trailer safely.,Nightly amphitheatre shows would be great!,2018,
Danielson,Nothing Is ever perfect.,,2018,
Danielson,Quality of park and amenities,,2018,
Moose Mountain,The sites were clean and fairly private. Access to the lake was good. Some of the roads in and near the park should be improved. Too many washboards and broken pavement.,,2018,All the camp fire pits should be on the ground. The ones on a pole are not very pleasant to sit around at night.
Greenwater,"Very nice campsites, well treed and clean park.",,2018,"The online reservation system should not combine 2 or 3 parks for the same day to begin bookings - I was online at 7am and was 2000+ in the que.  Also, once we were booked and paid and then still had to go thru the process when checking in at the park by phoning a call center to take down all the same information....its not neccessary!  I've booked the site - let us just check in."
Narrow Hills,The presence of conservation officers flashing their lights and pulling people over was too much. I'm all about safety but it was ridiculous. I appreciate their presence but believe they should be more lenient in terms of issuing tickets.,,2018,Please look into better lit bike paths.
Candle Lake,"Close to home, quiet area.","Would like More seasonal spots, I apply every year. Have had it a few years and enjoy it.",2018,More seasonal sites please...

Cypress Hills,Was a really nice park everything was great. Could have had better nicer firewood,,2018,
Makwa,Campground closed and locked up earlier than we would have liked.  We would have stayed longer but management instructed us to leave so they could lock up the campground.,Lower bbq/ campfire containers are easier and more pleasant to use especially earlier and later in the year.,2018,Would like it if Wadin Bay was open until September 30.  Saw park turn away multiple people as they closed too early.  Many people enjoy fall camping although the weather was exceptionally poor this year.  Missinipe was open but the access road becomes poor in the fall especially with rain.  Missinipe sites are not as nice and lacks the additional recreationa/educational options available at Wadin Bay.
Danielson,lots of empty sights but they show rented,get camp sight without reserved,2018,"reserve sight have to change,to many left empty"
Moose Mountain,The only issue was the boat launch. Not enough rocks were put in place before the final drop off ramp in order to keep the vehicle above the water level.  The dock was fixed to accommodate the water level but the boat launch was a disaster. Vehicles needed to back out so far into the deep water to launch and became flooded. This affected alot of people. There were many complaining and nothing was being done. Very frustrating!,,2018,
Narrow Hills,My family group enjoyed most of the park features. We took our power boat and really liked the lake level.,,2018,Almost all camping sites are gravel based with very little grassed areas for tenting. Unless you have a cabin trailer for those sites it is very uncomfortable and impossible to use tent pegs in the sites.   Why not have more designated tent sites that encourage people to enjoy some low tech camping?  Parks should attempt to keep camping costs affordable for the average family.
Crooked Lake,"I love Sandy Bay at Candle Lake but would spend a much longer time and more enjoyable time there if I had full service (water, power and sewer).  It stresses me to worry about sewer and water",Full service sites,2018,Full service sites please at Candle Lake
Narrow Hills,It was great. This is one of the best parks. Only problem this year was the public showers the water heaters must not have been working when we went so we ended up showering in a friends Rv . Too cold to even shower in.,,2018,
Makwa,Clean campground and easy access to lake,,2018,
Danielson,could not reserve for the desired week. had to take what was open.,,2018,"Please, please change the reserve a site setup to something more equitable to all! Alberta's Provincial parks system even makes it more fair."
22,It's always beautiful there. Lots of opportunities for hiking also.,More ews sites.,2018,"Last visit had a problem with the reservation. When we arrived, someone else was in our site. They were told to 'just pick one' and tell the park staff Aich one later."
Moose Mountain,Love nature.  Playground should be upgraded.  This one has been there since the 80's not safe!,Water tramps or slides. Diving docks,2018,
Buffalo Pound,My campsite had grass up to my knees. There are no showers. The check in phone staff were not helpful with my complaints even though they were fully aware that there was no other telephone service. The fallen trees were not cleaned up all summer. The womenâ€™s toilet lock has been broken for years and people often get locked in because the door wonâ€™t open,,2018,
Great Blue,"Clean, good campsites,",,2018,Would love to see more full service sites    Insure that free park admission for seniors is relevant any longer. It seems those that use the park the most - of which they have time to do - should have to pay their fare share.
Moose Mountain,The campground appears to have an over use problem Need lighting in allbathrooms .Vegetation is becoming less every year. and very trampled down .Wehave used thiscampground for over 50 years and except for the beach is much less inviting now.,,2018,Not really!!!

Duck Mountain,update the main shower house.,,2018,
Great Blue,Just a feeling,,2018,The bathroom/shower house in the Good Spirit campground was very disgusting and needs to be replaced or totally overhauled.
Rowans Ravine,The site we were given was a little challenging to get into with our Motorhome and there was minimum separation  from adjacent sites but apart from that the facilities and experience was good.,,2018,
Blackstrap Provincial,Weather cool,Fire pits low to the ground,2018,There was some toilet paper in my campsite on the trail to lake ?  One washroom appeared to be leaking water from base of toilet.
Danielson,"Well beside a good amount of people that drive too fast and the weeds on the sites, the bathrooms are always clean, garbage is being picked up, lots of things to do, its quiet.",,2018,Like I mentioned before the speeding was an issue. Specially meadows is easy to drive too fast and its dangerous.     Don't like the price hike at the Lonepine food and mini golf.    Maybe let foodtrucks in the park?
Moose Mountain,Itâ€™s self registering so I take care of it.,,2018,"The firewood at Mathewson lake is terrible, especially comparing it to kimball lake firewood only 10 minutes away."
Rowans Ravine,"Campsites were small, squished together, and or site was so dirty when we checked in.  I picked up a grocery bag full of little garbage littered throughout our site when we first pulled in.  I was even picking up dirty band aids.  Super dissapointed wth size, quality, and cleanliness.  We have camped provincial parks for 10 years now and this was by far my least favourite.",,2018,
Moose Mountain,Nice camp site good weather good service,,2018,Weâ€™ve camped here for over 20 years. We love it but the reservation procedures need work.  Also when I tried to get a refund for leaving a Day early they said I was 60 seconds to late and refused to talk to me.
Danielson,As a senior from out of province I would have liked a discount on our day pass as Saskatchewan seniors get a free pass don't expect it free but a discounted cost would be helpful,,2018,

Duck Mountain,Good fishing and campground,,2018,
Great Blue,"Good campsite, all services needed were available.",,2018,
Rowans Ravine,"We apply for a seasonal site every year and unfortunately, did not receive one this year. We had an extended stay site that was quite pricey, not private, along a busy road for our young children. Itâ€™s unfortunate that there are so many people cheating the system to get seasonal sites by trading with others who were drawn fairly instead of using the waitlist.",,2018,I really do wish that seasonal campers were offered better campsites and that there were more sites to offer families. We choose Pike Lake because of the proximity to Saskatoon as we are business owners and cannot spend time travelling to other lakes. Weâ€™d love to be able to have a site with a few trees and some privacy.
Candle Lake,The pool closed the day before we were going to go. And the lake was to windy for lake. Made us not come back to camp after. Pool is a must for little kids,Pool,2018,
22,The only thing I was disappointed with was the amount of goose poop on the beach. Iâ€™m not sure how you can get rid of the geese but it made it very unpleasant to sit on the sand or grass. Also I was annoyed by the number of people ignoring the â€˜no dogs on the beachâ€™ rule. Some even had them off their leash down by the dock right next to the beach. That needs to be enforced as there are many of us who donâ€™t care for dogs and fear for children getting bit.,,2018,
Candle Lake,I received a parking ticket from the Conservation officer for parking on grass meanwhile there was at least a dozen others parked on grass that did not receive a ticket .also park manager was speeding around the camp site also the way they went about the fire ban was terrible,,2018,Buffalo pound dump station is terrible 0 water pressure makes it very hard to clean your tanks properly!!!!
Pike Lake,Staff was excellent   Very good police presence   Lots of kids activities   Boat launches are excellent   Wood quality/supply excellent,,2018,
Buffalo Pound,Quit camping spot,,2018,For no sewer hook ups on site and no water hook ups the seasonal fees are ridiculous. We used to get a site every year in Bronson forest now I wouldnâ€™t waste the money to many other sites are less for the season and have all full hook ups
Great Blue,Love our sites,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,"As a seasonal camper, we like the convenience of being able to go out to Rowan's and having everything all set up. The park is clean, the beach needs some cleaning up but overall it's not bad.",Swimming pool,2018,Rowan's Ravine - A few years ago when some sites were flooded out they were never used again. Instead of restoring these back into circulation you have chosen to leave these seasonal campsites empty when there is such a high demand for them as you can tell by the number of applications for seasonal sites every year. There is also another section by the cabins that used to be the overflow camping that could easily be developed again for additional seasonal campsites.   There are long  term stay sites (more t
Duck Mountain,"Nice park, nice facilities close to fishing/swimming/golfing/groceries.",,2018,"I applied for one of the 75 seasonal spots and was 150 on the waitlist, was not impressed. Don't like it that people from Manitoba get a set over SK. If your trailer is from SK you should be from SK. I have seen people with trailer plates from SK but the dwellers are from Manitoba. You need to offer more seasonal spots, but if fees go up, then don't bother.  It is beginning to be too expensive. The park pass should be included in your seasonal price without an increase."

Meadow Lake,We have been camping at Makwa for 40 yrs. we were fortunate to get a site with having to move several times this year.,There is absolutely no recreation for children under 2-3 years. With the many swing sets itâ€™s the beach I would strongly recommend at least one baby swing.,2018,"We find there is a huge problem with campsites being booked for a couple days in s regular site. Out suggestion is if someone if booking lest than 2 weeks they should have to book in the 2 weeks max sites. That will open up the regular sites for people wanting to stay longer. Itâ€™s very frustrating when you go to book a longer term stay and right in the middle of your time , someone has booke 2 nights stay. If all the 2 weeks are occupied I get that..otherwise I think they should be utilized first. It tota"
Duck Mountain,Nothing to do with the site or the park.  When we were there in June the mosquitoes were unbearable and the heat and humidity were very high; uncomfortably.,More bearproof garbage containers..,2018,"We were very, very disappointed to see the private campgrounds that have poped up in Cypress Hills."
Moose Mountain,I think the boat launch at Murray Doell needs to be larger.,,2018,"We come every year for the past 10 years, to Murray Doell in Meadow Lake Provincial Park, and will continue to for years to come. We love the people, the quiet, the lake, the campground, the fishing, and the time with family & friends.  Thanks for keeping the parks great!  Just wish they woud expand the boat launch a bit & maybe add a couple more docks to set your boat while loading."

No beach due to high water. Many geese at the other beach
Battlefords,There were no issues at all.,,2018,

Itâ€™s the most beautiful part of our province.","More tenting and small camper van sites. Cozy ones, with trees left in them. Lower fire pits, in ground.",2018,"Generators and rvs have completely taken over the sounds of camping and the calm of the forest. Donâ€™t lose sight of why many people go camping, to be in nature. Not too set up the satelite dish and fit an entire mobile home in the forest. You have to cater to the needs of us tenters too."

Meadow Lake,It was later in August and wasnâ€™t as busy in the park so was a very relaxing vacation.  The washrooms and shower houses were nice and clean.  The only complaint would be that my husband and brother in law found the water in the menâ€™s shower house was scalding hot.,Iâ€™d like to see more full service sites in a better area. We originally booked for full service but after seeing the tiny sites that looked kind of grubby and  had barely any privacy at all we changed our reservation to the electric only sites which are much nicer sites!  I also find the seasonal reservation protocol very unfair for those of us who live in Lloydminster.  The people on the sask side are priority for seasonal sites in the draws but those of us on the Alberta side are left out. As we are a b,2018,Love the lakes in Saskatchewan!

Moose Mountain,Nicely treed camp sites. Site clean and ready for our set up. Swim area very nice. Flush toilet and shower area well kept,Better fire pits,2018,"Love Saskatchewan lakes, especially Bronson Forest area. Definitely would like to have campers told if the â€œitchâ€ is present. Our family experienced severe itch reactions which could have been avoided IF we had been notified that the parasite was present. Meadow Lake Park staff were aware of the problem, which apparently is ongoing, but no mention was made."
Moose Mountain,Very well maintained campgrounds and park. Some trail maintenance required but this is reflective of severe weather the winter prior to this camping season with many fallen trees etc.,"When Compared to Parks Canada, Sask Parks Please better enforce rules regarding ALL dogs being on leashes at ALL times in the campground and public areas.",2018,"We very much enjoy camping in Saskatchewan parks.   1. As occurred last year particularly and suggested earlier for this survey, Please provide clear and unequivocal reminders to all campground users and visitors to keep their pet dog(s) on a leash at ALL times.

When we arrived, we discovered that we were booked into a tenting site. Fortunately the campground wasn't very busy and we were able to choose an electrical site and move. The staff member at the park gate was very helpful.",,2018,

I know many of these were designed for kids, but there were many adults who attended the sessions, hikes, presentations etc.  We were not expecting this, so that was excellent and made a huge difference in learning about the Madge Lake area (I grew up about 45 minutes from Madge and learned lots from these interpretive programs).   Out of the three campgrounds we attended, Madge Lake was our favourite, so much that we were there three times this past summer and p"

Danielson,Sites are good.  Ample firewood,,2018,"Online reserve a site is horrible.  Campsites are hard to come by as due to being all booked but yet when at the park many are left unoccupied.  There should be a way of reopening sites that are not occupied.  Also, our last trip out someone had taken our site, so we had the office change our site.

Rowans Ravine,"Level of upkeep and security patrols have decreased substantially. Main showerhouse bathroom counters permanently dirty and shabby, half the taps trickle with no pressure. Cleaned infrequently. Infrequent shovelling out of barbeques, ruts in campsites not being filled in then it rains and its a disaster for kids and parking campers. Most disgusting is cleanliness of pool changerooms. Diapers, pads, toilet paper and dirt stayed on floors for hours despite bringing it to staffs attention. So disgusting that I",Security patrol from 7pm-7am...not an on call service that has to travel from 25+ minutes away. Many campers are woman with children only.,2018,Extremely disappointed in the parks we have stayed at this summer and previous 7+ years...particularily Pike Lake and Greenwater. Increased camping fees for atrociously maintained parks and buildings. We will be trying regional parks next summer
Great Blue,Everything is in walking distance. The staff were great.,Dark Sky Preserves,2018,The dump station at Cypress Hills near Meadows really needs to be fixed. The vertical stacks are a real problem and should be removed. I have never seen them at a single other campground and everyone complains about them. They are very unsanitary because some people just dump in the basin because the stacks prevent your hose from draining. Also one side of the dump stations is sloped away from the drain so your tanks cannot empty. It is your last memory of the place and it certainly isn't pleasant.
Moose Mountain,Having set generator hours or even no generator would be nice.  Abundance of watecraft beached in front of campsite detracted from beach day.,,2018,
Cypress Hills,We stayed in a walk-in tent site that was right on the water. It was beautiful! We were close to the service centre and playground. The facilities were very clean.,"The pool and water slide at Pike Lake is fantastic, it would be great if pool at Buffalo Pound was similar.",2018,Having a pool at Buffalo Pound is something my kids look forward to. I hope that the pool is repaired or upgraded (think Pike Lake Pool)

Pike Lake,Weather,,2018,"It is great to see improvements being made to upgrade services... new washroom facilities, more electrical sites, new sewer dumping stations.  Our parks are lovely, just hard to access.    Booking sites is still awkward and ridiculous to have to use 3 devices just to get a site!!  Double booking sites should not be allowed.... people cherry pick and tie up sites.  Bookings should be done within our own province!!!"
Rowans Ravine,The camp site was tended to promptly the staff polite and welcoming. The facilities were clean. The noise from neighbors was respectful. Lots of firewood left.   The pool was great. The garbage bins work well.,Better bbq/firepits,2018,"I would like to see different height and length restrictions on the size of campers for some of the smaller camp sites at pike lake. The large campers are destroying the trees and shrubs.    I get so stressed out at on line booking time in the spring trying to get a camp site. I donâ€™t know how to have that done differently but I know Iâ€™m not the only one that feels that way.    I also think (canâ€™t confirm)  many people of the same family book online to reserve camp sites for extended periods of time,"

Douglas Provincial,Wish the sites were full service,50 Amp service and water hook up,2018,There was a group camping next to us. They just moved to Canada 6 years ago.   They litterally walked into my families camp site and started using our fire pit to cook. I was too nice to tell them to leave but they didnâ€™t have a clue about proper educate while camping.
Duck Mountain,"The beach area at Pickersl point could use more regular maintenance (ie raking, removing debris, etc). The street lights were out at Spruce making it scary dark to walk at night, the booking of campsites makes it very difficult to book for a stretch of days - I was online by the booking time and already had 2500 people ahead of me - Iâ€™m not sure how that could be improved but itâ€™s frustratinf when I wanted to book for a full 2 weeks and couldnâ€™t as no sotes were available for that length of time. Long",,2018,Itâ€™s very nice to have the programs at Duck Mountain. My kids and I have thoroughly enjoyed them. Itâ€™s also nice to have the store and the park in general looked after better - makes the park much more enjoyable. It would be great to have swimming lessons brought back to the park too.
Blackstrap Provincial,"I had no problems, just checked right in and started setting up.",,2018,"I would like it if you could pay online with direct billing to your bank account or else PayPal, not just with a credit card."
Lac La,"Beautiful park we visit yearly, very poorly maintained. Roads are poor, from the main access to the roads within the campgrounds. popular ridge sites are overgrown the roads and site accessed in some location are washed out and difficult to access.  Some sites are very unlevel.  Per the cost question, I am willing to pay more if the park was properly maintained",,2018,
Duck Mountain,Beautiful spot,,2018,
Good Spirit,There is limited activities available in this park. We knew this when we booked but there isnâ€™t a lot this park has to offer other than campsite activities. We went twice but only because we had a family member in a seasonal site. We went early in June before the lake was likely to be green.,Covered firewood and a store within walking distance from the campgrounds,2018,Rowanâ€™s ravine was very well kept and garbage containers were well distributed allowing campers to do their part to keep the park clean. Covered firewood like at duck mountain would be a great addition. Echo valley is a nice campground but needs more amenities and activities within walking distance of valley view and aspen campgrounds. Duck mountain is a beautiful park. Only went once and the weather was unfavourable when we went. Would like to go again when the weather is better.
Moose Mountain,"Beautiful park, with plenty to do. Greig lake shower house was under construction, the trailers that were serving should have been cleaned more frequently as it was raining and muddy.   As well trail maps were not detailed and the trail markers did not seem to be consistent.    My biggest issue was a lack of dog friendly areas. With many lakes having limited water access there was no dog friendly beach areas.",,2018,Due to our location we had been camping at a national park more frequently. The one thing I appreciate in national parks is the amenities. Although most sask parks have sufficient camp stores most do not offer a dining facility. I have done alot of camping in many provincial parks and Rowans Ravine and moose mountain are the only ones I can think of with a restaurant.    Please update trail maps for meadow lake. There are so many kms of trails for everyone safety and enjoyment a more detailed map would be g

Candle Lake,"This is a beautiful park with very nice amenities (washrooms, shower houses).

Lac La,"Everything was great, except could have used more garbage pick up ... bins were overflowing. Also the washrooms could have been cleaner.

Meadow Lake,"Beach area is often crowded with people, their family toys and blow-ups, shade tent or covers. Certainly could be made deeper back into bush another 50 to 75 feet.  No effort to improve or enlarge the beach area for boats and PWC.

Great Blue,It is  very difficult to book 2 site close together  and book site at any provincial park as when you try to book on line it seems to be always book up.  We have to plan so far ahead if we wont to go camping just to try and book a site because we constantly have to keep checking if any sites open up.

How can that be when we went straight to the site and had supposedly no number! We did get a nice site in the end but very frustrating to book.  We love Kimball lake and will go back there again next year BUT I dread the online booking system.  It is also frustrating to see all the Alberta license,,2018,We think that it would be a good idea to let a resident of Saskatchewan have first pick of the campsites.

I stayed at 3.  I find the wood pile areas in the parks are very inconsistent. Buffalo pound pick up area at wood pile is not convienient or level....road needs maintenance. The wood pile itself is too far away from Trails end campground. They always pile the wood at the back of the fenced in site so you have to carry wood for up to 100 ft to put in vehicle.Not easy for someone with a bad leg or a senior.

The ability to add two campsites at once to the cart would be nice - sometimes you want two sites together but by the time you book one, the one beside it is gone.  Also for that reason, dual sites are nice, like Pike Lake.  All campgrounds should be updated to pit style fire pits, not the pedestal style.

If you are not let in quickly it is very difficult to get desirable sites or sites that are the right size.  We have repeatedly had to book in a different campground from other people we are camping with.  I would like to see Saskatchewan residents get to book a day ahead of out of province visitors. Saskatchewan residents deserve to benefit from our own Provincial Parks.

Battlefords,Everything was good except the fire bans.,"Better wifi, a significant fishing pier, outdoor kitchen sink attached to the washrooms and shower house, better fish cleaning station",2018,Better be planting more trees at Nighthawk Campground in SaskLanding and out at the Meadows and Buffalo
Pike Lake,too much parking on the roads because of obstacles set in place anywhere you might be able to park,,2018,get rid of online booking

Greenwater,"Have been there before, its's a great campground!  It is well maintained, shower house is awesome, plenty of trees to shelter you from neighbors, bathrooms clean and stocked, great supply of firewood, good boat launch and beach area.  Only improvement could be with the playground.",,2018,"I find that when trying to make a reservation, the web site shows all the sites are booked making it hard to get desired dates. Yet, when at the park, often half the sites are occupied.      This is the 2nd year in a row we could not get book at Douglas as we could not get 4 or more days together."
Duck Mountain,"The site was beautiful.  Restrooms updated with flush toilets near campsite, shower facilities also near and kept clean.","More hiking trails, although I realize the rising water shut down one of the ones we liked in previous visits.",2018,
Candle Lake,"Park rangers, workers were dedicated.",Electrified stage for performing. Licenced restauraunt.,2018,Could use camp host(s) in each campground. More vigilant presence of CO's.
Moose Mountain,The smoke and still to many dogs not leashed.,,2018,Getting a reservation for our desired time is still impossible.  Still to many dogs not leashed but roaming freely in their campsites free to bolt onto the road if so inclined.
Danielson,I loved our campsite and the wildlife that we see,,2018,
Meadow Lake,The staff and park are the best we have been too,,2018,The office staff at Buffalo Pound is terrible and has been for year. We avoid going there if at all possible.
Candle Lake,Clean and tidy. Access to clean toilets and showers.,,2018,
22,No reason.,,2018,
Cypress Hills,The park staff helped us move tables and helped us get set up for our family reunion. Excellent job by all of them.,Mountain Bike trails,2018,
Danielson,Dogs off their leash,,2018,Saskatchewan residents should get first choice at the camps sites a lot of the best campsites are only used for 2 or 3 days out of the week I can't for two weeks and see lots of great campsites empty for 2 or 3 days at a time

Candle Lake,"The sites were close to the lake, there were amenities available and you had space between sites.",Paved biking paths,2018,"I was not asked about our stay at Cypress Hills. Unfortunately it was atrocious compared to Buffalo Pound. The staff at the front were quite dismissive, wouldnâ€™t help me solve a problem with an online booking issue (until I spoke with someone and just told them to find me an open site!!! - simple solution they couldnâ€™t think of). The sites information was innaccurate. It is difficult to get into these sites as the signage around the campground is not longer one way. Theyâ€™ve split the once pull through"
Moose Mountain,Experience was good overall.   Previous years upgrades/maintenance to sites have left large rocks and uneven ground to contend with (inappropriate fill material).,,2018,
Blackstrap Provincial,If you run out of any food items you have to leave the campground and go to the nearest city (Saskatoon).,,2018,Yes I payed for two annual park passes but was not allowed to use any of the park wood because my seasonal site is operated by a private company. If that's the case then why am I paying full price for the park pass if i'm not allowed full access to all of the parks amenities.
Duck Mountain,Boat launch needs to be addressed. Has not been functioning at this park fir far too long. Very disappointing.,,2018,
Moose Mountain,"Clean sites, clean washrooms (except the shower were extremely hot for the entire week). Great beach access.",Redesign the fire pit/BBQ,2018,
Pike Lake,Good facilities.  Clean,,2018,
Duck Mountain,We were able to get our first choice of campsites and our group was close by,More water taps in all areas of the park so water tanks can be easily refilled.,2018,The signage is poor at Pike Lake.  When registering for a site at the admin office you cannot turn your trailer around and there is no place to park on the road.  There should be a water tap every 100 yards at a minimum so each campsite is never more then 50 yards from a tap.
Danielson,All Park amenities were open.,,2018,
Pike Lake,Some good campsites  Good beach and lake,Nicer more moder shower facilities,2018,
Battlefords,No issues,,2018,

Pike Lake,No problems,,2018,Booking campsites is quite frustrating and stressful esp.in rural  Saskatchewan where internet service is often very poor
Moose Mountain,More programs this year than previous. I'd like to see more though. They were quite fun and the kids enjoyed them.    Swimming lessons at Kimball Lake,More full service sites,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,Water in the showers was not warm enough and poor stream,Pool,2018,
Great Blue,"-people parked on the roads and nothing was done about it  -three of the seven nights there was noise disturbances after 10pm, one evening well into the early morning 230-300qm Partying/Squeeling tires...loud music.

Narrow Hills,"Everything was great...the only thing that could have been better was the person at the booth at the park entrance.  She never asked if we wanted the MasterCard receipt for our entry permit, and automatically through it away.  We had to ask for the receipt so she had to go fishing into the garbage can.  She also never asked if we wanted more information about the park...we had to ask for it.  One interpretive program (proper campfire making) was set for a Friday at 6:00...which is too early for most people.",More interpretive programs/entertainment...would be nice to be able to rent a fishing/pontoon boat.,2018,Enjoyed our visit...lots to do.  We will be back again.
Makwa,There could be a few more campsites added. Some could also be widened/lengthened to accommodate the larger units that come.,,2018,
Moose Mountain,"Had an awesome time.   Only reason I didnâ€™t give it a full rating was at the time of our visit there was signage on a few water taps indicating a boil water advisory, yet we were not informed of this at check in.  And not all posts had signage",,2018,
Rowans Ravine,its a very well put togeather park with very nice staff,,2018,It would be nice to have live music in the park I did see A BAND A FEW YEARS AGO AT PIKE LAKE DUING THE DAY AND IT WAS REAL NICE
Battlefords,"Park and main beach are poorly maintained over roughly last decade and almost all facilities are falling into disrepair.  Main campground service centre requires extensive interior and exterior updating and repair. Grass and trees do not appear to be getting cut or watered often enough if at all.  Firepits full of ash and garbage.  Heard several reports of park manager/admin assistant being  less than helpful  ,rude when asked to address grass and firepit issues upon check in.      I grew up less than a mil",Better fish cleaning stations. Eg meadow lake.,2018,
Good Spirit,Park is satisfactory,More showers,2018,Love camping at echo valley. Beautiful place.
Duck Mountain,"Nice beach , clean , but the store was under renovation",,2018,"Could you fix the road to Rowanâ€™s ravine so I can go back there without wrecking my 40,000 camper or truck ."
Candle Lake,Bathrooms were very gross. The arrangement of the campsites wasn't my favourite. Had to drive to get anywhere. Low walkability. Attended a burrowing owl presentation sat morn (which was good) and they were very loudly cleaning all the septic tanks. Had heard there was blue green algae but there was no information to understand how to identify it and know whether the water is safe. Pool was closed.,,2018,Fire bans are often called to late to make arrangements. We were going to Cypress Friday after work. Checked in the afternoon and nothing was posted. Luckily my friends got there before we left town and told us to bring propone etc. We usually only cook using the firepit so would have been nice to have a heads up a bit sooner. As we tent it also changes our activities in the evening so nice to be able to prepare a little more in advance if possible.
Pike Lake,The campsite we had to switch to for our final night had no privacy and people used it as a walk way through the campground.,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,Terrible system. Park occupancy is falling. Rude autocratic staff.,,2018,

Danielson,Great services. Well maintained park.,,2018,
Good Spirit,There are no activities or water equipment to rent. The only thing to do is mini golf (good ice cream!)  The out door shower at the beach has been broken for three years.  Most of the campsites are always booked but they sit empty all year.,Kayak rentals,2018,
Moose Mountain,Close to home and the wife and four boys love lac fed isles so much,A larger parking lot at the boat launch and maybe a larger staging area for vechicles at Murray doel,2018,Would like to see the online registry be available to sask residents first for two weeks before out of province residents
Moose Mountain,Wish there were more campsites. Always full have to reserve so early and then itâ€™s unknown if we can make it,,2018,The fees for fishing charged to non residents is extremely high.  We only come once a year and fish for maybe 5 out of the 9 days
22,Very peaceful and very beautiful,,2018,
Crooked Lake,Would like dogs to be allowed @ least in the parks near the beach! A dog canâ€™t stay in a hot car or trailer or tent when you want to go to the beach! And thats for all prov parks,,2018,More pet friendly parks with poop bag stations strategically placed
Battlefords,"Fire Ban which was illogical in June, came off for July long w/e yet we received more rain the w/e prior and fire ban wasn't lifted.  As a fellow camper remarked, 'It's called the long weekend'",,2018,"The individual sites could be better maintained-eg: previous campers leaving garbage, unburnable materials in firepits. In June there was a fire ban, the hazard could have been mitigated if someone had raked up the dried seed pods. We took a half hour and cleaned up our site. This should have been done by park staff. Hire some kids if you have to, hand them a rake and in very short order the place would've been pristine and no need for fire ban.  Please enforce vacating the site by noon. At times it is horr"
Duck Mountain,"Nice spot, happy with location",,2018,Need better garbage cans at Douglas bc of the bear. Campers are asked to clean their sights nightly but to put our garbage in not safe bear garbage bins
Duck Mountain,"great site, well maintained, love visiting Lake Deif., time spent with long-time friends",,2018,Camping at Douglas Prov. Park is always the highlight of our summer
Meadow Lake,Nice park. Well maintained,,2018,More availability of long term stay sites without having to move between site
Moose Mountain,The facilities at Kimball Lake met every need I had,,2018,
Crooked Lake,"Because of the booking system not able to get even 2 sites together with family. The reservation system is terrible. By the time I booked one sight, there was nothing else for me to choose near the one I had booked. Not sure if I will choose online booking again",,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,I found it troublesome to get wood.,,2018,
Duck Mountain,"Cleanliness of the washrooms, the showers (after pushing the button, the water would only stay running in the shower for about 20 seconds) could not even wash my hair properly, cleanliness of showers, store was under renovation and was open when we arrived but didnâ€™t have much for stock, and the mini golf was way over priced( we were going to play a round but turned around and went back to our campsite when we saw the price)..... The experience at Duck Mountain was disappointing and I will never go back.",,2018,
Good Spirit,Raining  and h ailing  long ways to the lake,walking  trails,2018,Not enough summer  and not enough  campgrounds in saskatchewan .  As alot of  alberta people  take the campgrounds

Meadow Lake,Weather wasn't the greatest,,2018,
Lac La,"nice park, nice campsite. kids had fun.",more full-service hook-ups,2018,"The french music festival at Pike lake was horrible. It was loud and disruptive. If I would have know that there would have been a music festival inside the park, beside the campsites, with people doing drugs, I would not have booked at Pike Lake this summer. Pike Lake is not a proper venue for a music festival. It is obtrusive and dangerous."
Danielson,Clean and services are fine. Mini golf needs serious repairs. Has gone down since we started coming every year going back to 2007. Food services are okay but not great there either. It is getting a bit pricey to golf and other activities are starting to get out of range of affordability.,,2018,
Good Spirit,"It has all the services that we needed to enjoy our stay ie. showers, firewood, water and electricity",,2018,
Great Blue,"Everything was fine, except weather",,2018,"No garbage service on a long weekend at Good Spirit was unacceptable, garbage cans were full and alot of garbage everywhere around. Site I booked at Duck mountain was so unlevel needed to jack trailer up 2 feet to level, not enough staff to level site, left my family for two weeks there in a full service site. Found out after that the A/C could not be used because of tripping the breaker. Wife was told it was a camper problem they could do nothing. I call bullshit, came home with trailer hooked up to a 20 a"
Danielson,Clean bathrooms with flush toilets and free showers. Plenty of space between sites so we didn't feel crowded.,,2018,
Blackstrap Provincial,yes,,2018,
Good Spirit,There was some theft and vandalism that happened while we were there.  i woke up in the middle of the night to our dog barking at people running out of our campsite.,,2018,

Rowans Ravine,Took forever to get a spot reserved,Cleaner finer sand- white sand,2018,Beach could be longer
Moose Mountain,Location and accessibility to fishing lakes,,2018,Remove barricade blocks at kimball boat launch and. widen to allow cartop carriers access without interfering with trailered boats.
Duck Mountain,Park is nice,,2018,
Blackstrap Provincial,Would be nicer to have better bathrooms throughout the camp grounds and not just at one location. Also would be nicer to have the firewood areas throughout the camp grounds instead of in one big pile which is stacked too high and quite dangerous when gathering the firewood.,Multiple areas to get firewood,2018,I really like the privacy offered at the campsites at Blackstrap.  That is why we camp here every year.
Crooked Lake,"Beautiful Lake, but campground needs cleaning, larger shower facility with laundry and Clean the beach...",,2018,
Great Blue,Very good trips.  Wood was on point for burning.,,2018,Thanks for the Disc Golf course.  Always a highlight of our family camps
Danielson,we booked two sites and one was the last one available and probably the least desirable for just adults. we don't have kids and ended up across from the playground.,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,Park & staff are good,,2018,"Although we always enjoy camping in the summer it seems as though there is zero enforcement of campers that bring their dogs. There is dog poop left everywhere in the park. We love to go for walks and it just seems that some dog owners just don't care where their dogs poop. We also encountered at Buffalo Pound (trails end campground) that people seem to think they can shower with their dogs. So, so disgusting!!!   Another thing that we have noticed is the amount of people that seem to think that drinking on"
Crooked Lake,The Park is beautiful and I like the Sand beaches,,2018,We enjoy Candle Lake.  It would be great to have a full service site to enjoy the full benefit of our camper.   The Roads to both Minow and Sandy are terrible.   Hopefully they will be fixed for the next season.    It would be great to have a better store at Minow the I would rather drive to Candle lake village and purchase from there than the lodge.at Minow.  All in all I do prefer Minow to Sandy for the beaches and  Sunsets.
Duck Mountain,Everything was great.  Wood was especiall good,,2018,
Danielson,"Love the hiking areas, and the lake",,2018,Please fix the roads in campsites - Rainbow and Warlodge particularly.
Duck Mountain,"it was well maintained, easy to find and above all: the natural beauty was preserved.  areas where people were allowed to mingle were free from cars and the noise and light pollution were minimal.",,2018,we''ll see you this summer :)
22,"I was able to book the site with an email contact (for 2019 have to wait until the new year and do it on the website, which Iâ€™m not very happy about - this was our 10th annual trip to the park and donâ€™t like not being able to book early).   Fire wood is provided - this is a huge bonus for the park, and very important to me.   Campsite is awesome and well taken care of",,2018,
Danielson,we have been coming to the park for several years and it is like coming home each time.,,2018,I understand the need to book campsites online and it is useful.  Could it not be available all year round though without the need to have everyone book on the same day?  we come every year.
Moose Mountain,"Poor condition of park. Roads were a mess, bathrooms frequently dirty, fire wood wet all the time.","Dry firewood,  put a roof over it!",2018,"Clean up the trails, they were in terrible condition and unkempt. Cover the firewood at Kimball Lake, trying to start a fire with wet wood all the time is ridiculous."
Crooked Lake,"Quiet, treed in campsite",,2018,Campsites need more maintenance (overgrowing weeds) and pre-check-in inspection to ensure campsites are ready to use and clean. I've found more and more people are careless in keeping their campsites trash-free and attracting unwanted wildlife.
Pike Lake,"nice area, clean.","camp ground hosts.  Lots of American National parks use this.  Great resource to go to for info, adds a presence to the area helps discourage parties and loud music",2018,"Although pot will be legal.  The smell is quite something else and that would really take away from the experience.  I already can't stand when people play music for the whole camp ground to hear.  If I have to smell pot being smoked now too I will just stop coming,   We love to see either campground host walking around who could enforce rules or call stuff in, and also see park staff or enforcement staff driving around to keep an eye on things.  More signs that clearly state quiet time rules, or have the f"
Crooked Lake,enjoyed the sight and people around lake,Better boat lauch at Minawaka,2018,My major complaint is the boat launch at Minowaka. It is I think an embarrassment.
Douglas Provincial,had everything I wanted  was clean and well kept,,2018,
Moose Mountain,We camp at Hirtz Lake. We saw that garbage wasn't changed daily or sometimes weekly. Makes us wonder if the bathrooms were cleaned either....,,2018,
Candle Lake,It was quiet and there were not too many noisy RVs.,A beach and a play area for dogs.,2018,Don't allow air conditioning in RVs to run all the time.  This is such a waste of energy.  They should pay extra for electricity if they will waste that much energy.

Good Spirit,Iâ€™ve been camping at echo for years.,Wifi would be great,2018,"Build more electrical sites, consider a marina, maybe a little store or food service right in the Paarl."
Pike Lake,We are very familiar with this campground and are happy with the improvements.,,2018,The lasf question is not appropriate for this survey therefore and would not have waisted my time doing this survey.
Duck Mountain,Fantastic Park,,2018,DO NOT have all your sites available to reserve on line.
Meadow Lake,Met all my expectations for this stay,,2018,No
Buffalo Pound,The campsites were clean and close to the water.,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,Poor way to have campers check in.  Park was nice and clean.  Road to campground very poor,,2018,
22,Other than having to move to it was a great experience. Even on opening day I couldnâ€™t book a week straight!,,2018,
Rowans Ravine,terrible weather at the time,,2018,beach area seemed to be in dire need of upkeep and cleaning
Douglas Provincial,We were told that there was 1 site left to book and yet campground had many empty sites { 21 first night and 16 the 2nd night }. That never did fill up but were booked.,,2018,Something  needs to change where if you are not in the site or have called they can let someone take the site. People with money are reserving at more then one campground and not cancelling the others. People with dogs need to pick up after them. Must be a limit of tents and people per site and enforced.. with a fire band costs should be lower. And smokers are still throwing butts in the ground during a fire band. Does not make any sense.
Lac La,It's a beautiful park. Well maintained with lots of amenities. Highly recommend and will re-visit in future camping trips.,,2018,"I really love the Saskatchewan Provincial Parks. I have been trying to visit all of the ones in Saskatchewan. The prices are reasonable for what you receive, however lower is always nicer on the pockets. Just a thought, what if there was a program for discounted camping if you camped more than 2 times per year (excluding seasonal) to drive an incentive for people to experience the parks and go camping more. Just a thought."
Duck Mountain,"Good reservation system, nice campsite, good service centers, good value. I think the campsites should have some amount of clean up/grooming by staff between reservations.",,2018,"Thank you for providing provincial parks with such good services, facilities and staffing. Our parks are some of the highest quality in North America."
Rowans Ravine,"Upkeep was a little lacking.... mowing, cleanup, garbage, etc...",,2018,
Rowans Ravine,wood to wet and bathrooms always a mess,better store more stuff to do,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,"it's a beautiful park, lots of roads for good walking, nice beach to sit and watch the activities on the water. The only suggestions to improve Rowan's Ravine is the highway into it is very rough & narrow.",larger dumpout site,2018,
Candle Lake,"Great improvement in the condition of the road to the park, disappointed in pool closure early in the season and the fact their is only one boat  launch dock. Wait time was an hour or more to get boat unloaded or loaded at times.",,2018,
Battlefords,booking sites is a nightmare,,2018,Saskatchewan residents should have a one day booking advantage over out of province campers as we heavily subsidize the parks with our tax dollars
Candle Lake,the pool was closed for the entire time we were there. they did  not tell us until we got there and then the pool did not reopen the rest of the summer. the pool is one of the main reasons we go there. We were not able to book anywhere else because everything was booked so we ended up going to BP and dealing with the no pool situation on one of the hottest weeks of the year.   :(,,2018,
Danielson,The set of sites that I chose were reasonably wooded and quiet. Felt like I was outdoors rather than in an RV or group camping setting.,,2018,"The picnic table was covered in children's chalk, which made using it messy. Better site maintenance between visitors would have that table washed down so that it was usable by the next visitor."
Narrow Hills,The services at the campsite were not ready when the park opened. There was limited acess to water at the seasonal site we were assigned. The water and bathroom facilities were shut down & locked up a weekprior to the seasonal site usage dates,Better lighting on the streets of campgrounds as there are always kids on bikes ect,2018,
Moose Mountain,"I love the park, being in nature. I've visited Meadow Lake Park since I was a child, and it brings back fond memories every time I visit.    Our campsite was adequate, and we had an awesome time with friends.",,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,It's very upsetting to see so many empty campsites during the week then see the campsites fill up for only the weekends.  There should be a minimum stay for most sites in the park to avoid people only booking on the weekends.  There is also lots of open treed greenspace in the park that could be converted to further campsites.,permanent seasonal camping spots,2018,
Crooked Lake,"The campground is clean, well kept for the most part.  Bathrooms not always clean but that might not be possible.",Full service hookup,2018,"I find it frustrating when you want to book a site for more time and the website says it's booked but the site is empty - I had adult children who wanted to camp while we were there but the website showed nothing available; however, I was there and there were a large number of sites empty.  Overall camping was great, it's the reservation system that's a problem.  I'd like to see MINIMUM stay sites - there should be minimal number of sites available for one night stays during prime time - should be at least"
Moose Mountain,It was fine.,,2018,

Good Spirit,"Uneven campsite, made leveling 5th wheel challenging",,2018,
Duck Mountain,I like the privacy on the sites.,All parks should have mini golf.,2018,You are asking to many questions.
Crooked Lake,the picture of the campsite on the web site did not appear to be the same ...the site wasn't as private as shown ...but other than that great time as usual at Candle Lake,the shower and toilet centers need to be repaired and maintained a little better it has been years and they need a face lift.,2018,"Just wish the spring reservation wasn't so stressful on the day of reservation. We have been camping for 40 years and the this reservation system is the best and fairest, just stressful on that day LOL"
Duck Mountain,"Very nice park, clean.","some more adventure themes, water trampoline, and boat rentals, more older child activities",2018,
Narrow Hills,Itâ€™s always our favourite place to camp.,,2018,
Moose Mountain,The wood was horrible,,2018,Very satisfied with the fishing and facilities
Good Spirit,Slope of site was too much in order to level motor home or trailer.,General store,2018,
Danielson,Overall the quality is good in this park.  Unfortunately though the online reservation system makes it hard to get a good private site.  There were lots of good open sites but because you can book so far in advance people often book but don't show up leaving good sites unused.,Free WiFi coverage. Most Alberta sites have WiFi coverage in the parks. It can be done but you must spend money!,2018,Don't allow people to book sites more than 2-4 weeks out! Make it so there is a large penalty for not showing up or canceling.  Also hold back 30% of your sites for later bookings to allow people that don't have the time to sit there and book ahead of time.  Do away with the lottery system and have a first come first serve for getting in to book your site.  Don't allow more than 4 consecutive booking at the same park.
Candle Lake,boat launch and weeds in lake,,2018,
Great Blue,Washrooms were adequate. Firewood was plentiful.,,2018,The beach is so well taken care of. It's a highlight of the weekend.
Good Spirit,When it rained the site was very muddy. It needed to be gravelled.   Also grass under picnic table wasnâ€™t trimmed,Rental equipment,2018,Pontoon boats are more and more popular. Boat docks need to be longer to launch pontoon boats. Also parking lines in boat launch parking lots would be highly beneficial. Some parks have but many need redone over years of fading.
Danielson,Was a good experience. Wished it could have been longer. The booking process showed the site as full. Went back the next day and it was still empty.,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,This campground was clean very nicely kept easy to find campsite washrooms close/showers close by. Lots of parking on site for guest.,,2018,I think they could be a little more private the sites other then that it was nice
Danielson,Cypress Hills has so much to offee,,2018,"Wheelchair parking spot at Cypress Hills is very poor& unsafe. There are a mere 2 spots behind the pool & its loose gravel, uneven,  ridges and on a terrible slope. This condition is unacceptable."
Meadow Lake,It is our favourite place to go in the summer. The campsites are very nice and the lake is awesome for beach and boating,,2018,

Makwa,Services were fine.  Washrooms were clean.,,2018,"Growing up in the Northwestern part of Saskatchewan, I really enjoyed camping in that area.  I now want to take my own family camping in this province, but find it frustrating to have so much competition to book my favorite campsites.  Especially when I drive through these campgrounds and see so many Alberta license plates.  I understand that we want to bring in visitors who help contribute to our economy through tourism dollars.  But I feel that perhaps there should be a window period of online registratio"

Lac La,"We've camped at Greenwater for many years now and every year the firewood is either soaking wet or muddy or both. We camp elsewhere during the summer and haven't had the same problem.

Greenwater,We were there for 9 days and then the storm hit. We had no power and was supposed to move spots July 7 but couldnâ€™t get to our other site because of all the downed trees. We opted to leave as my husband and older son were going for a few days and I didnâ€™t want to stay with no power with our youngest. I would have liked to have come back when power was restored as we had booked from June 29-July 16 but they wouldnâ€™t let us back in until the park reopened Wednesday July 11. Was disappointed to see peopl,,2018,I would like to say the staff at Great Blue Heron handled the disaster zone well that night after the July storm in the pitch black trying to help people. I voiced quite a few times that the bathrooms should not be locked at night as there was no where to seek sturdy shelter if we had to get somewhere other than our camper or vehicle. It was nice to see when we came back when they reopened that they kept the bathrooms open 24/7. We love coming to this campground and will be back as much as we can. I have to
Meadow Lake,Garbage bins not emptied regularly  Beach not maintained/groomed  Bathrooms not cleaned well,,2018,"Change the booking system. We are on the site as soon as it opens and when we actually get in to the site, it already shows every single campsite unavailable, then when you drive through the sites in the summer, most sites are empty but online they show booked."
Danielson,"The one night we had a truck at about 10:30pm driving back and forth revving his truck and partying. It was handled by about 11:30, but we felt it should have been handled sooner as the gentleman was drinking and driving way to fast through the park.",,2018,
22,"it was everything we expected it to be. Washrooms where clean, there was lots of firewood available.  The park was very quiet at night.",,2018,"WE think that residents of Saskatchewan should have first chance at booking campsites before people from other provinces can book. Also people booking just weekends should not be able to book sites until after the start of booking on line, as they cango in and tie up a site every weekend and someone wanting to book a week or two weeks can get in because sites are tied up every weekend and the days in between are left open."
Greenwater,"Campsites were clean, staff was (as always) very friendly and easy to deal with, the campground was quiet, we have always enjoyed camping here and will continue to go back in the near future",,2018,
Cypress Hills,Itâ€™s a nice park quiet and very kid friendly,,2018,They need to have more seasonal sites at crooked lake . Of course weekends are always booked but during the week a lot of empty sites. If they had more seasonal would mean more money for the park. And when people book 2 or 3 sites on a long weekend and then cancel last minute and other people trying to book but nothing available because of people booking and cancelling . They should have a much higher cancellation fee .
Narrow Hills,Stay every year for many years now. Easy commute to work daily,Water hook up,2018,

Rowans Ravine,The site was well treed and offered privacy. With young kids we were able to set up games in the large site and allow them to play in the site or take a short walk to the play areas provided. Cost to camp was very good and the staff were friendly. Waterslide was great as well.,,2018,
Danielson,"The weather cooperated and we enjoyed the other people we were camping with.   We were not near any of our friends, which was not very convenient.",,2018,"The reservation system is very stressful and frustrating.   It is almost impossible to plan a family vacation with relatives or other friends when you are 1,600 in the que.   A person is lucky to even get a site in July unless you have a low number in the que.  Checking back as the Spring progresses for vacant sites has not worked.   I am not sure what the solution would be."

Danielson,People beside us washed thier dishes at the blue water pole with camp people driving by and they did nothing. Many people had dogs that barked and they left the dogs poo in the bushes. People with dogs should then be sent to the medows to camp away from the main area where people walk. Many people did not listen to no fire restrictions. I dont want to see my favorite camping place go up in flames. Cypress hills is just getting too slack just to have the people there. If it does not change we will go camping,,2018,Saskatchewan residents should have first chance to reserve campsites before Alberta residents. They have Elkwater on the Alberta. They come to cypress on weekends and go back to work in the hat during the week this is not allowed but not enforced. Alberta residents say cypress sask side is way cheeper they dont have to pay for wood or showers . This is so unfair
Narrow Hills,"Do not like the $12,00 fee for each reservation. When we camped in August we stayed for 10 days, moved 3 times because one site was not available for our entire stay and we had to pay $12.00 three different times ($36.00).",,2018,Upgrade campsites. Many unlevel sites that are difficult to level your trailer. Lots of sites hold water. Lots of sites too small for larger units.

Great Blue,Very poor showers,,2018,Strongly disagree with being charged a 10 dollar reservation fee for each reservation even when I'm booking all the sites at one time. Then a 15 dollar change fee is applied if I have to change it.
Danielson,This trip was fairly similar to every year that we go. I had hoped for more shows at the Ampitheatre but it was already fairly cool in the evenings at the end of August this year.,Alberta's reservation website is much better set up. Only book 3 months in advance so you don't have to try and plan for the end of summer in March.,2018,

However the fact there were only 3 sites available when we got through the queuing system it was frustrating to see all the full sites empty when we almost didnâ€™t get in.

Lac La,"Campsite was tight, service center shower timers were set too short",,2018,Roads in campground need improements
Duck Mountain,The camp site are the best ones we have ever camped in as far as privacy. But maintenance lacks more and more every year. In 2017 there was a shower in the 200 facility that was out of commission and was never fixed for the 2018 camping season either. An outside light at the 300 showers on the handicapped end wasn't working in 2017 and we told them then and told them again in 2018 and it was never fixed. It seems like until someone gets hurt they don't want to bother fixing things. Why are they not concerne,,2018,
Greenwater,This is not 100% your fault. Our camper was destroyed on the morning of July 7th.I was very disappointed that the shower house was locked between 11pm-6am. I was informed later that the shower houses are unlocked in sever weather situations. This was not done and how are campers to know this happens. My wife was injured from the tree and we are still working with chiropractors and physiotherapists which we are paying for.,have the shower house open 24-7,2018,"After our incident with our camper, we came back to our campsite on July 8th to pick up a few last items since the tree was removed from our camper, there were a few items stolen from our site over that 24 hours."

When I reserved online there was only 3 sites available to choose from.  When at the lake you could have shot a cannon thru the place and not hit anything it was so empty.  This  comment was echoed by others at the park at the same time.  Also, it would be nice if the store and boat rental facilities stayed open till AFTER the labour day weekend."

Rowans Ravine,Everything went almost according to plan. With the exception of part of our site was roped off due to new trees that we were unaware of when we booked the site. We have stayed in that same site before and we have a large tent that we had to figure out where to set it up.,,2018,

People throwing rocks through windshields while parked at the boat launch  Garbage cans were over full. Walking trails had windfall and poor signage. Trees over hanging roads, I am pulling a fifth wheel that I paid good money for and there are trees rubbing down the side and roof of my unit as I drive to our campsite, not impressed. Had to drive down the loop backwards to be able to back our trailer into the site properly"
Saskatchewan Landing,The seasonal campers think they own the park.  We had a small pool filled with 4 inches of water and had to put it away.  While there were 4 other HUGE swimming pools in 4 seasonal sites with over a foot to 2 feet in their pools and did not have to put them away.   There was a 4 year old boy driving a motorized small car around the campsites.  He almost ran into our car so asked how old he was and he said 4. WOW that should not be allowed but his grandpa said he can drive cause we are seasonal campers!!!!!,more entertainment,2018,

Sask landing is a fully irrigated facility yet over the past 10 years the irrigation  system has not been used.

22,We couldn't give a  completely satisfied  grade as we felt the upkeep of the park was somewhat neglected and not as well maintained as in previous times we visited the park.,More daily activities /more electrified sites/wasp control/fire pits cleaned on a daily basis /well stocked store/wildlife control on the beach...clean the goose and duck droppings on the beach area/larger signs posted to keep pets leashed and away from the beach,2018,When booking sites online perhaps give each provincial park their own individual day to reserve.

Meadow Lake,Campsite was in great condition as always. My only complaint is that the raised rectangular fire pits with an open front in some campsites are impossible to make a comfortable fire in for a group of people. These need to be replaced! The raised round fire pits with the stalks of wheat on the side are much better.,,2018,The lottery reservation system is very panicked and frustrating at the start of the year to get a reservation! I am not sure how to make this better but it seems there must be a better way to ensure that people are able to reserve the campsites they wish to stay in without racing to whatever is available on the given morning.

The staff that work at the campsites are always friendly and helpful which makes it an even better place to visit.    The only issue/concern we have is with other campers constantly running generators throughout the day and night.

Other campers had a pit bull that was leashed, but it was obvious by the thickness of the dogs's very heavy chain and aggressive manner that it was not the type of dog to have in a public location.  Public safety was an issue.  Worry about what this dog could do, if it got loose, to our own dogs and to our child was a constant concern.  Yes, it will be difficult to control",,2018,No

We raised our concerns with the owners first but it did not help. We currently do not  have a pet but did so for many years and followed the rules and kept our pet quiet ! On the upside we had very good service with park security when we called them.   Also kudos to the bathroom cleaners--awesome job!,,2018,

I think the wood had been cut from trees that had fallen in an ice storm the previous winter. That should have been stacked or hauled out instead of lying about. As well, we booked for two weeks, around the July long weekend. But we saw a lot of empty sites during 11 of those days.

It's sad to see fees increase as we don't get any more services. (I know some sites are now full service but you pay more for them... I'm referring to camping going from $18, to $20, $25 a night..) Camping use to be cheap... it isn't anymore. Maybe have discount fees for staying longer. Like pay for 4 nights but stay for 5.   Don't have ppl book fall camping on line that's crazy. They pay a reservation fee when they shouldn't need to,.. most parks are not busy in the fall. Also fall camp"
Saskatchewan Landing,Always clean and comfortable,,2018,
Moose Mountain,I am frustrated that this is a sask park and yet sask reisidents dont get first choice of sites. There should be a Saskatchewan day for booking sites and then open for all others. The majority of people are from Alberta and they seem to get the prime spots. Also the for those that want to stay the summer they have to move multiple times.,,2018,I just wish sask residents would have priority to book campsites first. Our taxes go to he running of the parks and I think it unfair that so residents should have to move campsites like 9 times to stay for a month at the park.
Duck Mountain,no complaints,boat rentals,2018,
Lac La,"Firewood provided was damp. The fact that the management for the seasonal sites and the entry to the actual Campground were run by two different offices. We'd ask questions at one office, told we had to go to the other office to get an answer.",,2018,I use the parks a lot more when it was first come first serve. Now with this reserve a site business it seems that many sites are going unoccupied for extended periods period which seems unfortunate. There should be some mechanism to get those sites occupied at the last minute.
Danielson,"Washrooms were clean, campsites clean and mowed, quiet",,2018,"There should be either more first come campsites, much higher fee for cancellations, only can book one week at a time, can only book a month in advance. Find it very hard to go camping which in turns affects the activities that the parks have available as less people can attend."

Buffalo Pound,Nice level site,,2018,Shouldnâ€™t have to check in if it was payed for online in advance.It is a waste of resources to have someone answer a phone to check off that people are at the site they already payed for. Have to fix the road to Bronson forest or you will have no one going there because the road is so bad. We camped at stabler point the other 2 times simply because the road is better.
Moose Mountain,I found the bathrooms a little dirtier than in previous years.,Additional family programs,2018,
Lac La,I love this park and did see improvements being done but would really like to see work done to the roads.,,2018,
Good Spirit,Nice site and complete/ full service,,2018,It is a great experience to relax and unwind to stayed in any sask parks.  AWESONE!
Douglas Provincial,Good fishing,,2018,"When there is a fire ban, make it very clear when people enter the park. When someone lights a fire for the SECOND TIME, ban them from all provincial,parks for the rest of the year. DO NOT allow fire outside of fire boxes. We camped by a group who lit a fire on the side of the coulee hill at Blackstrap. No enforcement and it was bone dry and windy."
Duck Mountain,Great staff. Atmosphere. BUT there was a huge booking who kept coming into our space in the moose campsite.,Wifi,2018,
Good Spirit,Nice park,,2018,
Danielson,Everything was good,,2018,
Duck Mountain,L,,2018,
Meadow Lake,Too many boats left in water overnight or days on end not being used therefore no room for people that want to park boat at beach or fishing dock area just to spend an hour or two at the beach or reload with other family members. These people also leave their boat trailer at the boat launch area tying up parking for people that load and unload daily. There is a boat trailer storage area that isn't being utilized by the people that leave their boats in the water when they aren't even around for days on end.,,2018,
Battlefords,"Bathrooms dirty, too many dogs, pit bulls should not be allowed at parks, roads have never been fixed, overall unfortunately the park is run down",,2018,Cypress hills is by far the cleanest most well kept park.
22,Things seemed to well kept. Outhouses and shower houses were clean.,,2018,
Buffalo Pound,After researching little fishing lake online we were disappointed at the campsite as there was less to offer than the web page said there was,Store and showers,2018,
Good Spirit,No maintenance was done to the park.  Tree branches ripped the roof of our trailer.  Rules are made but not enforced.  Other campers had their vehicles on the roadway.  Washroom/showers were being used by non campers.  The floors in the bathrooms were washed with a wet dust mop.  Will not be returning.,Enforce the rules or donâ€™t bother making them,2018,"Fire Bans should have been put on more parks, ie Echo Valley    No kind of fire should be allowed during a fire ban.    Portable fire pits should not be allowed during fire bans.    Rules need to be enforced.    # of people allowed on a campsite"
Duck Mountain,All amenities were well maintained,,2018,
Danielson,Nice park,,2018,
Narrow Hills,Everything was great,Off grid sites separate from rest. Tired of the giant trailers and their satellite dishes.,2018,This survey was too long.
Douglas Provincial,No full service sites,Information centres about the area,2018,Better quality fire wood and replace rotten rusted out fire pits
Buffalo Pound,Just felt that way,Waterslide,2018,Trees
Moose Mountain,Campsites clean & neat. Semi private as well,,2018,"Your seasonal rates are very high for just a site with power. Also preference is given to Saskatchewan residents over Alberta residents, yet Albertans are encouraged to apply anyway. I feel that all applicants should be treated fairly. Overall we love camping in your parks."
Lac La,Good amenities  Wasn't a fan of the beach nor the large quantity of goose droppings on and around the beach area  Enjoyed the tree cover and many trees in the campground  Felt that many of the sites in the lakeshore loop could've been levelled better and not on such a steep hill,,2018,
Battlefords,Great park  Nice site,,2018,Fire ban was on but seasonal sites were having fires
Meadow Lake,it was an enjoyable experience for the whole family.,,2018,none
Battlefords,"The whole process from reserving to check in was very professional.  The line up was long to check in, but it was handled the best they could.",,2018,
Candle Lake,Just enjoyed surrounding atmosphere,,2018,
Moose Mountain,The park was saying it was full yet there were lots of empty sites the entire time we were there,,2018,Try harder to get the site's full as its hard on the store owners when the sites aren't being used. Its not fair for people who want to go camping
Danielson,bathrooms were not cleaned very well thank goodness we had a bathroom in our trailer but I felt sorry for the tenters that had to use them all the time  Many times there was no toilet paper and paper towel available. We were camping right by the washrooms and we watched the cleaners come look around and the drive away without doing anything. That is not acceptable my books. Mini golf could use some repair.   otherwise overall experience was good,why does there have to be a gate fee.  in alberta there is no gate fees to provincial parks,2018,no
Moose Mountain,We have enjoyed Meadow Lake for many years (approx.12 years now) and enjoy the peace of nature.  The campsite at Sandy Beach is very quiet with no loud evening parties.  We love to hear the loons and watching the deer as they pass through our site. The maintenance staff is great (val) and the entrance gate (dorothy) great people.,It would be nice if they could grate the roads just a bit better. is hard on the travel units.,2018,
Good Spirit,Smooth camping trip.,,2018,
Danielson,Facilities are very good. Lots of trails to keep us occupied. Well kept.,,2018,
Danielson,We quite enjoy our time every year because of the scenery and activities in this park.,,2018,The weeds in the campsite areas need attention.
Greenwater,These campgrounds are fantastic,,2018,Thank You!!!
Duck Mountain,Good site.,,2018,
Good Spirit,"I was only #10 in the line up on line, so was able to get 21 days together.  Loved where we were at Echo.  Will definitely try to get there again next year. Very clean, quiet, and the children loved it.  Not much traffic in the park.  Wish that the showers weren't so far away.  Had to drive to, and it would have been nice to walk to them.",,2018,"I would rather have the 21 day stays, rather than book in to different parks for 7 nights each one.  Was nice not to have to move trailer back and forth from camp to camp and home again.  I hope to be able to do this in 2019.  Also I didn't know that seniors got free access?  I paid for the park pass on line."
Greenwater,"We enjoyed our stay.  The first night we arrived, there was a big windstorm and lots of trees went down.  We did not have any damage but the majority did.  We realize this is beyond Sask Parks control but we do wonder whether the stability of the trees is a concern - many were uprooted which shows the shallow root system.",More full service sites would be nice.,2018,We enjoy our stays Sask Prov Parks.  We would choose full service if we had the option but there are so few in most parks that they are booked quickly.  I am not in favour of the legalization of marijuana so I am not in favour of any thing that makes the public usage of it easier.  I do realize it will be a nightmare to police itâ€™s use in campsites but I still canâ€™t agree that it should be encouraged.
Greenwater,Campsite was clean and quiet. Had no issues.,,2018,
Good Spirit,Love that campsite.  We usually go once a year and book the same site.,,2018,
Moose Mountain,It's a very nice park. Very clean.,Better quality firewood,2018,
Moose Mountain,"I've been camping at the meadow lake provincial park since I was a child & the showers at kimball lake have not been updated since then. 35 years & even the hand dryers are the same ones, some doors don't work since shoppers barely work. Still the best campground though.",,2018,
Danielson,"First of all it is virtually impossible to get on to the site, when it opens for bookings.  There should be notations as to whether the caller is  booking for exteneded vacations (i.e. two to three weeks) not just weekends.  Prior to the summer of 2018 we were unable to book two sites for a period of 14 days, and it wasn't a factor that we coulld'nt be close together.  We are from Alberta and don't have a problem with the veghicle parking fee if we could get a two-week stay.","We suggest that your folks who are handling the reservations for the park on line ask the question  are you only booking weekends or are you booking a seven, fourteeen or twnety-one day stay  for the vaction season.  Then the second day it is open for everything.   Consequently this would give folks a chance to book their vacation for the seaspm.  As it turns out, for the summer of 2018 we booked a fourteen day vacation together with our families  at Christina Lake in B .C., so far we have re-booked at Chri",2018,"Unable to get a booking for our annual summer vacation at Cypress Hills - we have been at Cypress Hills,for many years  prior to the summer of 2018."
Moose Mountain,Site was beautiful. Great amenities.,,2018,The online booking/reservation system is terrible! Also it is ridiculous that we can only book for 2 weeks maximum stay!!
Good Spirit,It is peaceful quiet clean and safe,,2018,We absolutely love the park and cannot imagine life without being there
Rowans Ravine,"Really appreciate the abundance of good firewood available.  Park staff keep the park looking its best.  Good sites, private, lots of gravel, good set-up.",wifi,2018,"I think the Camp-Easy option is a great idea.  It gives people the opportunity to camp, or at least try camping, when they would not otherwise be able to do so.  Very reasonably priced."
Great Blue,Awkward to park .Campsies  are small,,2018,Reservation fee to change is ridiculous amount. If person was involved tjere would be more reasonale dhoices..wouldnt have to move for one night to extend visit. Get rid of online
Battlefords,Clean,,2018,
Good Spirit,Site was secluded and quiet,,2018,No
Narrow Hills,Itâ€™s a nice park,More water taps in the campground,2018,
Danielson,I like the park,,2018,"I hate the reservation system, sites now sit empty through the week and are full only on the weekends. No more then 30% of the sites should be reserved or those staying for a week or longer should be given first chance to book the sites."
Douglas Provincial,The Showers on the 100 side are awful!!!!!!!!  Cell coverage totally unacceptable!!!!!!,"Cell coverage, need the beach area maintained at the over flow so people in park have a place to swim.  Convenience store at overflow for Danilson.",2018,Need a convenience store at over flow at Danilson.  Need better wash room/shower facilities in the 100 side.  Need CELL coverage.
Meadow Lake,The campground is beautiful. Facilities are cleaned regularly. Wood is well stocked. We did have an issue with someone parked in our campsite making us unable to park our trailer. We were not sure of the next step as the front gate was closed and it was after hours.,The availability of laundry services would be a nice feature at makwa,2018,I still feel that Saskatchewan residents should be allowed to book campsites first. I believe that everyone should only be allowed to book one site at a time per household. I become frustrated logging into the reservation site and being 1100 on the waiting list to book a site and then camping in the summer to see mostly Alberta licence plates in all the sites I would have chosen. I love that Alberta residents enjoy our lakes and campgrounds but I don't enjoy them taking precedent over our own citizens.
Meadow Lake,The sites are kept in fairly good condition and the beach is kept clean.  Also the wood supply is almost always kept up.,,2018,
Moose Mountain,I would like for the group site at Meadow Lake Sandy Beach to have a portion of Electrical sites spread throughout that specific area.Most sites to have sewer hook ups throughout Sandy Beach. Water availability is very satisfactory. Very willing to pay extra for electrical/sewer that are not just seasonal.,See previous comments on   fairly satisfied comments,2018,We appreciate being able to return to our original home area and still support the local area and  Saskatchewan proudly.
Blackstrap Provincial,"We chose a lot that was big enough to accommodate our 5th wheel based on the website specification and that was fine, but there was hardly any room to be able to maneuver the trailer into the lot .  There were lots of low untrimmed trees that we had to move out of the way and remove the camp number pole in order to get in the lot.  We were with a party of three - 2 5th wheels and a motor home and we all had the same issues/difficulties getting into our designated spots. Could not park in the lot once camper",,2018,
Makwa,"Because there are not enough staff to enforce simply rules like how many people are allowed in a campsite, multiple sites had more than 6 people. This leads to not enough bathroom facilities, and people shitting behind my tent. Then there are no staff to clean up the shit and used toilet paper.  This is a health hazard, that having enough staff on site would have prevented the problem in the first place. I hate this reservation system, but it helps fill the parks...so use that extra revenue to STAFF the par","More back country or tenting sites to be available on a walk up basis.  I don't know in January, that I will feel like camping on the third weekend of August.",2018,
Pike Lake,Beautiful and quiet we go every year,,2018,
Duck Mountain,You need more water taps as I needed almost 200â€™ of hose to reach the closest tap. Since I camp here lots I knew to bring lots. Also instead of taking all the sand they scrape off the dock and dumping it in a stupid place they should reput it on the shore to build up the black. If afraid of it blowing back to 5he dock put up a snow fence to protect it.,Your boat launch is sadly lacking in ease of use,2018,Pleas3 consider putting in more water taps in for ease of camping
Danielson,"Campsites are well maintained, clean washrooms, lots to do, love the trails, swimming pool is great, good food options, quiet.",,2018,Really dislike the reservation process.
Crooked Lake,"weather was great, wood was dry, washrooms were clean",,2018,
Danielson,"enjoyed our site in Meadows. Nice flush toilet outhouses. like the minigolf, swimming pool, golf course, zipline, many activities and free firewood. but there should be a cover/lean to over the wood pile to keep it fairly dry",online booking 90days in advance instead of the whole summer to be booked in one day.,2018,great time with friends. Rainy so wish the firewood would have been covered so that we had some dry wood available.
22,poor weather for enjoying the breach,keepng the beach and lawnfree of goose litter,2018,filthy beach area due to canada geese  worth a minimal fee increase to hire personal to deter birds
Narrow Hills,The site was messy not cleaned up like it normally would be.  Also noticed some sites had sand added to them.  Not level amd the trailer just sunk in the sand.  The park normally uses pea rock or gravel.,"Staff who clean up,the sites",2018,
Pike Lake,It was fine,,2018,
Danielson,It is totally annoying to fight online to get a site and end up with a crappy site and walk through the campground to see 98% if the decent spots occupied by Alberta plates and to see empty sites that remain vacant days on end,,2018,
Makwa,Conditions and sites were well maintained and the staff took good care of the facilities and came around each day to check on things.  there were thefts around our sites probably 5 nights that we were there but we know to put things away so never had anything taken - many around us however so they did deal with those fairly promptly and Deb kept us in the loop!,Interpretive program or board with things to see and do and visit around the area.,2018,
Lac La,We camp at Greenwater every year because it is our favourite park.,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,"Rowan's campsites are relatively poor for privacy to begin with. No bush, lack of any sort of privacy. Pictures of this site online looked to be relatively normal. Reality is though, our fire pit and picnic table are literally 15 feet from the door of their camper. We booked early, the site location was good for us, but if had any idea how  friendly  we would be with the neighbors, we would have booked another. Better pictures would be great.",,2018,"Roads out to Rowan's still suck. Always makes me debate booking out there.   Let things grow at least a bit out at Rowan's. Privacy is a good thing, and makes me more likely to want to go back. Especially the group camps - the way they are right now, why bother with the hassle?     Camped at Echo - something needs to be done to maintain the facilities better. Showers at the upper campground are filthy. Curtains are nowhere near long enough - literally 2' too short. Causes water all over the floors, which ca"
Saskatchewan Landing,"Itâ€™s hard to enjoy your camping trip when almost everyone letâ€™s their dogs roam free and they come to my campsite where my dog is leashed! A couple times a dog fight occurred, very disappointed and almost packed up and left the one time my dog spent most of the day in a kennel becuz the dog at site 311 next to us roamed free and kept coming over.",,2018,"I feel people that donâ€™t leash their dogs should be fined, someone could get hurt. Also there are some people afraid of dogs and donâ€™t want them running up to them."
Danielson,Quiet,,2018,It's all good!
Blackstrap Provincial,Clean sites and bathrooms. Great swimming pool. Lots of firewood but crappy camp fire pit heights (too high).,,2018,
Duck Mountain,love the park...needs a better booking system...as many of the 100 block campsite were empty during the week!,,2018,"The campsite are empty during the week, the booking system needs to change. More work needs to go to people who want to book their site for the whole year...it is hard for people to get these long term sites as people are booking for 1 or 2 night...ie Friday night and Saturday night.     I strongly suggest a separate booking day for long term bookings (ie minimum 2 weeks) first and then open to the rest for the two day bookers. this will help improve the bottom line and fill the parks every day! please feel"
Saskatchewan Landing,site was nice. park was nice,,2018,
Great Blue,"clean sites, good privacy, quiet, good wood, close enough to major city",,2018,"Rowan's Ravine has a very poor road leading to the park.  For a Provincial Park it should have better access.  That factor has affected our decision whether to visit that park again or not.  Otherwise, we love that park."
Moose Mountain,"Poor supply, storage, and quality of fire wood, when during our time of stay it was cool,and often wet..",Place firewood in a storage with a canopy or roof over it,2018,Do not allow commercial fishermen to net in ANY Provincial Lakes and Waterways
Moose Mountain,water did not drain away from site after rain storm,,2018,
22,It is a great environment to take our young family.     There are always kids the same age to play with.    The overall atmosphere of the park is very quiet and relaxing.      The store down at the main beach could be a little nicer but it works!,,2018,
Duck Mountain,Everything went well,,2018,
Good Spirit,"Love the maintenance crew and how well they do their jobs. The bathrooms however were always in need of cleaning, even after someone would come by to check on them.

Moose Mountain,"I have come to the same park and stayed at the same lake for 40+ years, it has been a family tradition that has been passed down from my parents who my family has been enjoying for years and hopefully for years to come. The changes in online booking and being able to book a 3 week stay and not have to move sites has become harder every year. Yet when you look at the usage of sites many are empty, full service site that I would love to book were not available but sit empty for days. Then there is the the tra",,2018,

This is not condusive to burning and makes it very difficult to start the fire. The air holes need to be at the bottom of the pit.
Candle Lake,wood is to far away from campsites and even with reservations that we had made prior to arriving took to long to check in. If you have to pay for campsite shouldn't have to pay entry into the park,No Dogs,2018,Reservation site is so backed up on day opening to reserve online. Its hard to get a site. Need more campsites in all parks
Danielson,Everything went as planned,,2018,I would like to have more full service sites available
Great Blue,Campgrounds were clean and well kept.  Beach was clean and raked daily.  Fireworks for Canada Day were great.,,2018,
Great Blue,BECAUSE SINCE WE HAVING BEEN COMING TO GOOD SPIRIT FOR MANY YEARS THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THE BATHROOM IN BALSAM CAMPGROUND OTHER THAN A NEW SHOWER HEAD FINALLY THIS YEAR.  HONESTLY ONE BATHROOM AND ONE SHOWER FOR ALL OF THE BALSAM CAMPGROUND.  DO YOU NOT THINK YOU COULD MAYBE INVEST SOME MONEY IN THIS AT ALL!!!!   EVERY OTHER CAMPGROUND WE HAVE GONE TO HAVE A LOT BETTER BATHROOMS THAN THIS.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.  A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ATTEND THIS CAMPGROUND FEEL THE SAME.,More showers and bathrooms in Balsam.  One bathroom and shower not enough in the building.,2018,I am a little baffled about the question about cannabis.  Do we have any say in if it is allowed at a campsite once it is legal in Canada?  I can't really see why this is a question.  I wouldn't want it in the campsite but really do we have a choice?
Danielson,The park is a dark sky preserve and Iâ€™m an astronomer.  Also lots of day time activities.  The park was also very clean and safe.,More information to the general public as to why the park is a designated dark sky preserve.,2018,

Meadow Lake,On line sites need to be updated. Our site was not nearly large enough even tho it said it would hold a unit up to 32 ft. Totally unsatisfactory...especially with slides.,,2018,People that work there should understand how the Que works when booking a site and how hard it is to get one youre satisfied with. It was frustrating to hear one asking us why we didnt get a differwnt site and that we should be checking them out. We have been going there for 20 plus years and it is getting more frustrating Every year!!
Duck Mountain,I have camped there numerous times since I was small.  My kids grew up there and now their children.  I have never seen the crow so horrific in my past trips.  Day and night very annoying.,Advertising for specail events that are happening,2018,Only the fact that we were out when there was a live band playing this year and excellent fireworks going on we could only hear due to lack of advertising.  It's too bad someone wasn't going around informing people of this.
Meadow Lake,Nice hiking trails (though a recent storm flooded one trail and knocked over a large tree on another). Fire wood was nearby and was usually well stocked. Campsite was quite large.,The fire pits are not great. They don't allow enough air flow in compared to other designs.,2018,
Pike Lake,"Campsites were very limited and not marked very clearly. There were also some fallen trees at one site that appeared to be right on one of the campsites - again it was hard to tell because each site was not marked very clearly. Also, there were no bear poles to string up food and other scented items. I've done a lot of backcountry camping, and that surprised me. I found a suitable tree far away from our tent, but not everybody would be prepared or willing to do that.","Bear poles at backcountry camping sites.Food always needs to be stored safely, and with no vehicle nearby to keep it in, bear poles are a real must.",2018,I also stayed at Douglas Provincial Park in early May and I was very impressed with the facilities.
Battlefords,Meh,The roads are far too narrow. They need to be expanded to fit today's size of campers and boats. It is scary to drive on those roads,2018,Canping is a place for children and families to enjoy themselves. There is absolutely no reason there should be drugs available to be used in front of my children.
Danielson,Park has nicely kept sites with sufficient amenities and clean facilities,,2018,
Moose Mountain,Good service and great camp ground.,More full service sites.,2018,
Blackstrap Provincial,Site was as promised,Multi sports court area. Tennis/basketball.,2018,"Enforcement of pets being on short leashes, or leashes all together is insufficient. It would be nice to go camping without dogs barking, ect. Either a ban on pets in campgrounds or have a pets only campground area would be ideal."
Crooked Lake,Shower water not warm enough  Not enough playgrounds or kids activities,More campsites with sewer service. Better wifi,2018,"Need more campsites! Spots fill up too fast and not everyone can book holidays in may. That in turn forces people to reserve dates just in case they can make it and often times later they just cancel and lose their 5 bucks.  Camping is getting more and more popular as people who previously traveled further on their holidays can no longer afford the gas or plane ticket  etc. to do so... So yeah, need more sites and/or more new campgrounds in sk"

The gravel parking lot at the entrance of the campground by the Express checking looks like a disaster, it used to beautiful in there with all the trees.",WiFi,2018,"The Seasonal Campsite rages are way too expensive for the services you get.  Also there needs to be enforcement on the rules, people are pushing bush so badly to fit their 5 tents, boats, seadoos, etc..  there is little underbrush left in a lot of the sites due to this.  Do not provide gravel for people as they put it in the bush to make their site bigger!!"
Candle Lake,no pool and the beach was full of bird poop!,spray park,2018,if the pool doesn't get fixed please clean the beaches better.  I like the idea of having the lifejackets close to the lake...great idea.
Good Spirit,We found the site we reserved unsuitable for our new trailer. The staff were friendly and helpful and we were easily able to relocate to a larger site that could accommodate our new travel trailer. The staff are always great and the facilities at Echo are always clean.,Would love to see more pools available.

Battlefords,We love saskatchewan landing. We would've applied for a seasonal again but funds were tight but always find a way to do a few days of camping,,2018,Please lower the seasonal prices
Douglas Provincial,because it had a nice boat dock,,2018,no
Moose Mountain,"The boat launch is bad, dock was too short and the fire wood was real bad!",Better boat docks,2018,There is a need to have sites that are not booked online!
Moose Mountain,"Beautiful lake and campground, very friendly staff",,2018,
Danielson,It has everything we need. Things for the whole family. Free wood. Free showers. Someone to empty the sewer for a long stay. Tuns of things for the kids to do. Quiet at night. We love cypress hills.,,2018,I wish the reservation system was better. We camp in Warlodge at cypress hills and there are never sites open when you book online but when you are physcially in the campground there are always open sites and it's super annoying when your favorite campsite is booked online yet you walk by it each day you are camping and it is empty.
Rowans Ravine,"Amazing time, beautiful park, friendly staff, everything we needed.",,2018,
Narrow Hills,facilities were clean no assistance cleaning firepit.,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,"the park is well cared for, the facilities are always clean and there is usually a great supply of firewood",there is a true & real need for wheelchair accessible sites to be paved/pavers,2018,my brother in law is a quadriplegic in a wheelchair and as mentioned in the past I believe wheelchair accessible site and washrooms need to be more so accessible as in paved or pavers not just across from the washroom with larger doorways
Crooked Lake,group site had no light to see to the bathroom at night .And could use a few more eiectrical sites.,,2018,no
22,Lovely park with excellent hiking trails and it is dog friendly,,2018,"We love your parks, especially after Labour Day"
Meadow Lake,There werent as many Albertans there woth their huge trucks and boats blocking roadways. The campground was quiet again and clean.,"Murray Doell has park staff teaching kids different things on the beach re bears, plant life, etc. Great idea.",2018,Theyre great the way they are.
Candle Lake,No pool,Horseback riding,2018,Was very disappointed that the pool at Buffalo pound was closed all season. This was a main reason for going. I would hope this will be opened back up next season.
Moose Mountain,Great beach.   Quiet campsite.,,2018,
Good Spirit,"the sites were properly groomed before our arrival, there was plenty of wood available for  campfires.  unfortunately the lakes had algae so there was no swimming.",,2018,
Candle Lake,The trip went well and we enjoyed many of the amenities but due to a fire ban we were not able to use the fire pit.,,2018,
Rowans Ravine,Nothing to say.,,2018,
Danielson,Have always camped there and live it,,2018,
Moose Mountain,Fishing at Lac Des Isle Was terrible. Between 14 of us fishing a week we never landed one walleye and very few pike,,2018,If the fishing was as good as the groupsite at Murray Doell our group would be back but due to the terrible fishing we are forced to go elsewhere. Some of our group drive long distances for our weekly fishing vacation and poor fishing is not acceptable.
Blackstrap Provincial,Beach services were closed. Camp office far from most campgrounds.,Late Sunday camping check-out! Wi-Fi. Electric vehicle charging at main beach.,2018,The roads should be paved or the grade reduced in Sunset Ridge.
Great Blue,Everything was as expected and we had a great time.,,2018,Keep up the great work and donâ€™t increase the prices.
Saskatchewan Landing,Everything went fine and we had a good time,,2018,
Lac La,Cleanliness of campsite and common areas. Good golf courses nearby. Available dry wood for burning.,,2018,Feel safe and secure with current enforcement of substance use. Hope legalizing pot will not make the drug visible (or more importantly smellable).
Makwa,Because the attendant was most helpful in assisting us. Your 8oo # was a disaster (yellow phone ) as they had no record of our confirmation nor could they find us by name. She was friendly and able to help out with any questions we had.,Maybe a bit more visable staff in late evening as we had a theft incident.,2018,"When making reservations, your staff should really know park layout.;as a 35 ft motorhome does not fit into a 25 ft. campsite.  Other then the theft issue and poor choice of site for brothers motorhome all of our visits where very enjoyable. You have to do something about your contracting out for reservations. Terrible."
Douglas Provincial,It needs a store.,,2018,I wish there were more dumping stations at all parks and a store at Danielson.
Duck Mountain,"Love camping there, great camping sites, excellent store, great beach, lots of walking.",,2018,All parks need more power sites.
Rowans Ravine,No privacy too open the parks need a upgrade on equipment.,Splash park.  Dog park area.,2018,

Duck Mountain,All the things we look for in our summer getaway were satisfied.,,2018,"Wonderful to have the log cabin selling local goods and crafts!  I was delighted to purchase a cookbook of local recipes which also contained pictures and history of the area .  This is, btw, our favorite sask park!"
Blackstrap Provincial,Itâ€™s a nice park with good amenities,A store!,2018,I enjoy the park but I think there should be an option to book more than one stay at a time for one reservation fee.
Meadow Lake,Some noise issues and not always clean,,2018,"When I see so many out of province visitors taking advantage of our parks i question why their fees are the same as mine.  As a resident of SK, we pay for the development and upkeep of these great parks/areas.  Why don't out of province visitors pay at a different rate than provincial residents?  I think their park fees/camping fees should be slightly more than residents of SK."
Moose Mountain,I usually camp at Sandy beach for the month of August and was very happy to get a campsite for the month and did not have to move.,,2018,More security on the lake. I saw at least two instances of persons bathing in the lake complete with bar soap or body wash and shampoo. Even bio degradable is not acceptable in my world. There are shower facilities available for bathing with these products.
Rowans Ravine,"Lots to do, clean, lots of staff",,2018,
Greenwater,"The park was great, but we bring two vehicles, and Sask Parks does not have a program as Parks Canada has. With Sask Parks we are forced to buy 2 full price annual passes, with Parks Canada we can purchase an annual pass at regular price and an additional one for $15.00..what a great deal!! This allows us to pull a camper with one vehicle and our boat with the other without breakingb the bank.",A duplicate park pass being available for purchase at a discounted price for a second vehicle,2018,
Danielson,Unable to book sites online for longer stay as it was â€œfullâ€ so we stayed inMaple Creek for two days but then found many empty sites which our trailer would fit in on days trip to cypress.,,2018,
Duck Mountain,Campsite was clean when we arrived.bathrooms were clean,,2018,

Greenwater,The park has developed wonderful trails for walking and biking. They're wide and well maintained.  The staff are very accommodating and friendly.,,2018,"We experienced a horrific windstorm July 7 at Great Blue Heron Emma lake. The staff from the park and emergency measures staff worked efficiently,tirelessly to comfort and assure the campers.The devastation and destruction of personal property was extensive. These men and women worked in an organized  manner with dedication and professionalism. The safety and security of the campers was always first. The beautiful forest setting was altered by the winds and we are so saddened that all the love and work they"
Duck Mountain,"Store was open and actually had supplies in it, wood was dry, site was clean, beautiful park",,2018,"The campground office at DMPP never should have been closed, and hours should have stayed the same. It is very inconvenient when you have to drive from the campground all the way back to the admin office to pay and get your park entry pass. That being said, the park gates probably should have stayed open too. The whole set up is inconvenient and unwelcoming."
Danielson,Because it was relaxing and we alwasy love going to Cypress Hills....just wish the weather would have been a little more co-operative!,,2018,no
Crooked Lake,"Very difficult to book consecutive days for our stay, seems like weekends book up sites and then have to move if you want to stay more than 5 days",Introduce the ability to book full weeks -Sunday to Sunday prior to opening up to book partial weeks. This way campsites aren't sitting empty mid week and visitor who want to stay more than 5 days aren't having to pack up and move sites! This is done at some Manitiba parks .,2018,Please look into improving booking system
Narrow Hills,Bathrooms in area we stayed getting tired.  Some days not cleaned as well we are used to in the parks.,In Manitoba there are more parking areas for boats extra vehicles etc to keep congestion off of campsite roads,2018,Facilities like bathrooms including supplies and cleanliness are being taxed because there are bigger and bigger groups in campsites.  Great that so many people are using parks but then more staff needs to be working to deal with large numbers.
Rowans Ravine,"Checkin was quick, we were taken to our site and shown around including the checklist of items that were in the lock box.  We didnâ€™t look inside the tent, wish we would have since it was very dirty and the zipper on the screen door was broken.  Also the camp stove was disgusting, caked in grease and took a lot of paper towels to make it useable for boiling water.  The location of the tent was great, close to the washrooms and was well treed and private.  We were told to call when ready to checkout and som",,2018,
Moose Mountain,"Durning our stay at Murray doell campground the icecream stand staff we loud durning the nigh kept my husband and myself up. We were shocked that the parks ranger was not present to enforce the campsite rules especially considering we saw them throughout the day and usually they are doing there night rounds,  But also surprised that the staff were not following the parks rules. Campers on the hill from the icecream stand all probably heard the noise.",,2018,
Duck Mountain,"The firewood was decent, the sites stayed stable during a lot of rain, bathrooms and showers were satisfactory and the group of friends we meet there every year is awesome! I think the only thing that would be excellent is if the beach was better at our campsite and we didnâ€™t have to drive to the other beach.",,2018,Itâ€™s the highlight of our summer to meet our friends of nearly 20 years at duck mountain. As a family we will be spending more time camping next year at a few other campgrounds too! Itâ€™s the best way for our family to unwind and reconnect.
Rowans Ravine,Nothing special for the price.,,2018,Campsites should not be available to book so early. People book them up and then dont show up. The whole week we were camping the park was fully booked yet a good 25% of the sites were empty. Some sites should be first come first serve or maybe open for booking a month in advance.     Staff were speeding around campsites and not watching for pedestrians.  When I went to office to complain they were very rude!
Duck Mountain,Itâ€™s a great place to camp,,2018,I would like to see the full service sites be given the 30 nights for the price of 21 in May/June like you can book in the electrical sites. Iâ€™d also like to see reduced camping rates in September as well
Rowans Ravine,We love the proximity to Saskatoon but still be at the lake! We pick a site by the laundry so the facilities are close.,,2018,
Pike Lake,"In general, I was satisfied.  However, I had to wait 1 hour to use the shower house on Sunday morning, as it was closed for cleaning.  One hour seems a bit excessive, although I must say, it was nice and clean when I finally did get in.   We got a warning about not having a park pass, although we had a sticker on our window, in the same place as last year.    We inadvertantly parked in the wrong site and had to move part way through our stay.  The park warden was very pleasant and polite. even though it was",,2018,See my previous comments.
Meadow Lake,It is a wonderful camp site. Unfortunately we had to move after 1 week from full service to electrical for 2 weeks and then back to full service for 2 weeks. All because we were unable to register fast enough to get booked for the full time period.   There were other camp sites near us where no one stayed during the week and yet they didn't have to move of course because they got booked in for the whole time period. Doesn't seem right somehow.,Speed bumps going into the park to slow down traffic for walkers and bycicles.  No one goes less than 50 in 30km zones! 15 km zones aren't even considered for slowing down!!!,2018,It would be great to consider a way to allow seniors to have a way to reserve camping for whatever time frame ahead of others to avoid having to move once or more times over the summer. For example you could: Let seniors pay the full price for the summer for a chance to have an early reservation time to book their dates and enjoy the full summer without losing a day each time they have to move. That would be a true way to honor seniors for their contribution to our province as they have been committed to fa
Narrow Hills,Stayed in Lynwood and the bathrooms were disgusting. I had to ask if they were going to clean the bathrooms. The bathrooms need a refresh.,,2018,Update bathrooms in the 300 loop in Douglas. Update bathrooms in Lynwood Campsite at Moose Mountain. Limit number of units/ tents and cars per campsite and enforce it.
Pike Lake,"for our week in june when we called regina, we were told we could not reserve a site in june. only july & aug.  not sept .. we got to the camp late  after the park office closed. we set up some that evening & the rest in the am & just finished setting up to get told we had to move because we are in a reserved site... WHEN WE CALLED WE WERE TOLD WE COULD NOT RESERVE IN JUN OR SEPT..  we had to move to another site.",,2018,hotter n hell in june & aug... frickin cold/wet sept.. ice on the wash basin in the am.
Buffalo Pound,There is only running water in the toilets by the seasonal. The ones by the overfill were full and stunk.  there is no showers and there is never any wood. The biggest thing is half of the campers in the seasonals have Alberta plates and are never there. That should be something that gets looked into more.,Showers and clean washrooms,2018,
Narrow Hills,We were able to get the site we wanted online and our stay was good with no issues.,Better wifi service; hot showers,2018,Quit increasing the price per night. At Moose Mountain especially clean the facilities better like the washrooms compared to Buffalo Pound or Rowanâ€™s Ravine. Buffalo Pound needs a new improved access road to the park...terrible disgrace of a trail into this park.
Douglas Provincial,Itâ€™s average,Pools,2018,
Battlefords,We like the park    It is lacking showers at riverside and a sewer dump station.     The beaches should be groomed more often    It would improve the park by grooming the beach by riverside as well    Ants are very bad.,Power water sewer sites,2018,

Crooked Lake,Met all of our expectations,,2018,"Absolutely hate the reservation system  Not everyone knows 6 months in advance when their days available to camp are.  You are putting many people at a disadvantage such as farmers, self employed business owners and people caring for elders who donâ€™t know when they are able to get respite.  To me this a form of discrimination.  A certain percentage of all available campsites must remain first come first served to accommodate these people.  The other thing that is really unfair is to see seasonal sites go"

The last few years they have closed down Fish Creek campground and squeezed everybody into the smaller campground (Linwood).  It is always full even after the long weekend so you end up with no site anyway.  It would be fine to close the central houses as most people who are in a camper can do without the washrooms.

Moose Mountain,The only reason we were completely satisfied was we were selected early in the draw to select a camp site and got one we liked.   Previous years not so lucky with camp site selections even though lots of sites sit open for a number of days.,Requie a safe place to park boats and boat trailers not on the roads in the camp sites.,2018,Been coming to Greig lake every year since the late 1960 and have always enjoyed each visit.We find the security very lax .This includes the number of vehicles and boats being parked on the roads in front of camp sites very dangerous for young children and adults.Vehicles.

Danielson,"We took showers in our trailer and the water burned out skin, not hot water burn but like a chemical burn. Once we got home, we both got infections, we can only surmise from the water. This is not the first time that the chemical in the water was so strong that it burned the skin, this time it was pretty bad. We aren't going back to the park any time soon due to the water quality.

Danielson,Park was clean well kept and lots of activities.,,2018,
Moose Mountain,Road conditions in the park. Very rough not grade enough,,2018,
Battlefords,"It seems like the maintenance of the park has gone downhill the past few years. We have been going to SK Landing for many years, and they no longer water any grass, when water is plentiful and would eliminate the need for fire bans. The sprinkler systems are all in place, they just need to be maintained! It is no fun camping without a campfire. The dead trees do not get trimmed, and the weeds/grass does not get cut as much as it used to. The roads are also getting worse every year (ie: potholes, etc)",,2018,"Fire bans are unfortunate, when there is a watering system in place that would prevent that."
Duck Mountain,"Campsites and amenities at the park are wonderful however the campsite booking system is completely flawed.  In my opinion, certain areas of the campground should be set aside for long term camping ( e.g. more than 3 weeks).  Certain very large sites that could accommodate a large camping unit were reserved for a weekend with a tent set up in them.  When that weekend falls within a long stay campers schedule, it disrupts the site for the entire 3 weeks.  Therefore, the parks loses money as that site stays o",,2018,Again the park and Madge Lake is fantastic.  My only 2  suggestion would be to look at the terrible park reservation system and the boat launch at Pickerel Point campground needs maintenance / refurbishing.  Very rocky launch area creating damage to boat trailers and very limited parking for trucks and trailers.
Narrow Hills,Good service,,2018,
22,"it is more of a general Sask Parks,  the booking system.",,2018,"Booking System, is unfair for those who want to book more time, as we are the ones who look after the park during the week, and you are getting paid while we there or not.  To book like a hotel is not getting the week day spots any revenue."
Saskatchewan Landing,Shower pressure and heat of the showers need improving. Also camp programming was minimal compared to the last time we came to the park.,Swimming pools at Buffalo Pound or Echo sometimes lakes are not good for swimming,2018,I feel the pool at Buffalo Pound needs to be repaired for sure noticed while we were there a lot of empty sites and we camped in July in the height of camping season. The main reason we booked Buffalo Pound was for the swimming pool.

Saskatchewan Landing,Yes,Overflow / none reservable campground even if means no electricity,2018,Our go to campground is Echo Lake as we know there is always a site available as they have Unserviced/none reservable sites. We like to go camping on the spur of the moment   Our trip to Duck mountain was a little disappointing campsite and washrooms were great but the park was overall run down
Moose Mountain,No complaints.  Easy to book.   Great site.   Had a fun weekend.,Walking trails along water fronts,2018,
Greenwater,We have been camping at Emma Lake for 12+ years and always love it,,2018,When booking a campsite online it is very frustrating when trying to book a site for 5 weeks or more only to discover that it is unavailable only because someone booked a couple night stay and ruined the opportunity for an extended stay.
Danielson,Because there are several campsites that are reserved and there is never any unit in them but on the website or at the office they are not available to book. Seems like a serious misuse of campsite. We are never able to just show up and get a campsite because they are all booked but when you arrive there on a reservation in a crappy site and see all the empty ones it is very frustrating. I have heard many many people express their frustration over the same thing. It should be run more like a hotel and if th,Clean lake and usable beach area. Perhaps another or a larger swimming pool.,2018,Cypress park is a beautiful oasis which is very busy with campers. There needs to be a better more useful system put in place for the reservation of campsites and the availability and use of them.  There are several sites that are empty when the computer says they are full. I realize that the park is still collecting money for those sites but they could get more money by having them occupied again and have happier people using the park and spending money in the park at the store and fast food and any touris
Good Spirit,Clean facilities & appreciated unlimited use of boat ramps.,,2018,Most enjoyable vacation!
Good Spirit,Never have enough power sites available,,2018,
Danielson,"I would have liked to get a spot closer to the couple I was camping with, but since Sask. Parks started using this system of online reservations a few yrs ago it is almost impossible for us to be side by side, which is disappointing. I preferred sending an email the beginning of Jan to let you know what we wanted. Now people seem to book more than 1 spot, so many are taken & then are empty. I don't know what the answer is.Maybe a red flag has to come up when a name appears more than once for the same time f",,2018,"I very much enjoy Rainbow Campground in Cypress, but it is hard to get the campsite I want even in June, before school is out, when going online before 7am on the very first day fo register.

When I book at a hotel, I do not pay for the privilege of reserving a room.  In fact, I am usually able to get a discounted price by booking in advance online at a hotel.  When we reserve a campsite, it is helpful for the employees to have advance notice on how many campers to expect.  Instead of appreciating the advance reservation, we are charged for making it.  Even WORSE, when I was at Cypress Hills and was in -person in the office to arrange for a campsite, I was charged fo"
Buffalo Pound,Refund for shortened reservation was only allowed on original charge card. new card so had to wait for cheque,,2018,
Pike Lake,Some campsites arent set up good for length of trailer they are marked for,,2018,
22,"The online reservation process is, in my opinion, quite inefficient in that it is extremely difficult to book more than 3 or 4 days in the same campsite, even when using the opening online reservation format.  The system still gets backlogged during the initial booking phase.  It is also frustrating to see campsites sitting vacant for several days at a time after trying to book those same campsites for that time frame.  I have tried to book a seasonal site for 4 years with no success.  The size of our unit","Larger, more full service sites",2018,"The roads throughout the Battlefords Provincial Park are horrendous.  I think that there should be a separate area for storing/parking boats, as the roadways are narrow enough without trying to navigate around large watercraft to gain access to one's campsite."
Lac La,"Pro - Everything was clean, the site was a good size and private. The shower building was always clean. There were lots of activities if you wanted to participate.  The people at the check-in desk were very helpful.  Con - The individual bathrooms lights in our area were burnt out and were not replaced the entire time we were there so had to take a flashlight at night.  Would prefer sinks in those bathrooms.

Rowans Ravine,Good place,,2018,
22,I think the bathrooms in the campground looks should have hand sanitizer stations in them.    I really liked that there lots of water taps.  But they aren't always near the bathrooms. Hence the need for hand sanitizer.,All bathrooms in cypress have sinks.  It's great.  Landing bathrooms have hand sanitizer but no sinks which is better than nothing.,2018,Love camping at Sask Parks!  Our province has so much to offer!

Great Blue,Smaller site than expected,,2018,
Narrow Hills,All was good except firewood storage facility could have a better roof on it so that wood stayed dry.  Also a person across from us that had a seasonal site was spraying chemicals with a back pack sprayer to kill dandelions......and I was cooking at the time.  There should be some sort of rules about applying chemicals to sites. Totally illegal without a pesticide applicators license and should not even happen when other campers are in the campgrounds!,,2018,

Also if the group reservation is now online it would be nice if it launched the beginning of the year so itâ€™s is easier to make a plan, people have to book there holidays by January for summer so it would be a lot easier if t"

The shower house was not cleaned well and sanitized every cleaning , and there were minor repairs that never ever got done - like fixing a broken shower head.

The current system which is just a piece of cement is very dangerous. We saw a senior trying to help his buddy put the boat on their trailer and he fell off the cement pad and luckily he did not receive an injury. A boat launch and dock like what is at Stabbler point would be much safer. Steel narrows launch is used by many campers and it should be safe for us to use.

It is getting increasingly challenging to find a campsite at virtually any provincial park,,2018,"We would go to Rowan's Ravine park, however the access roads to that park are horrible.  For that reason alone, we don't go there to camp.  Went there to fish in winter and then again in summer and am sorely disappointed in the state of the highways.  Won't be going back until the roads are fixed - to fish or to camp.    Also disappointed in the mad rush to book a campsite on opening day.

That is totally unnecessary.",Upgrade Greig Lake outdoor bathrooms around the camp loops like BC and AB have.,2018,Booking on line - Too many 14 day max stay sites which is unnecessary at Greig Lake loop 106 - 150.  If you are a paying customer why should it matter how many days you stay in ONE campsite.  Campers should not have to move. You are there to relax unwind.  There should be minimal 14 day max stay site or none at all.   The sites that are 14 day max site is a joke - if you have more than one email you can book back to back stays anyway as I have seen this.  So again why have 14 day max stay sites as there are

Douglas Provincial,The store in the park wasn't open. Sites are very difficult to get...often booked up by out of province.

This is an extremely busy area in the spring and I hope the province can keep up with enforcement protecting our fishing for the future.

Blackstrap Provincial,I was under the impression that ALL campsites were being updated with electrical.  Long line-ups to get into the park - even with a pass already.  Not a lot of selection at store in park.,A good store to buy groceries and food items to barbecue.  More snacks.,2018,

Meadow Lake,There was no one at the booth to check us in Friday night.  No one came to check that we even had a reservation over the weekend.  We did not actually enter the Provincial Park because the campsite is right next to Jumbo Beach and the booth for checking into the camp is miles further down the road.  And yet we paid for entrance into a provincial park.  We could have picked a spot for free as long as nobody else wanted it which would have been awesome since we paid for the park fees and didn't actually enter,A check in spot with map of the campsites and someone knowledgeable to direct people to them.  We drove around a bit to find our campsite and then our site itself was easy to find.,2018,"Saskatchewan is beautiful.  Being at Makwa was very relaxing once we got settled in.  It was the lack of check-in process which was disconcerting.  There was only one sign, not on a main road, which helped us find the campsite.Pulling a trailer around dirt roads with cabins close together is not fun on a Friday night when others are doing the same.  It was a bit stressful."

Pike Lake,As in all provincial park campgrounds the online reservations causes problems for us campers who are travelling and not sure where we will lend up that day. We can book a spot for one night only and we are informed that it has been booked for the next couple of days (online). This happens quite often when it is close to a weekend. It is unfortunate that people are allowed to book weekends only.  It has happened quite often that we have been in a campground and told that it is all booked up and then find tha,A number of campsites that are available on first come first serve basis. You can not reserve those sites online.  This accommodates campers that are travelling.,2018,I am not in favour of having all campsites available for online reservations.  Also am not happy with the fact that campers can reserve weekends only.  Too often you hear of families wanting to book a two week reservation only to find out that they will have to move off the site for the weekend.

Blackstrap Provincial,"Great site, great camp sites",,2018,
Candle Lake,The sites weren't as close to our neighbours as we had hoped and we couldn't switch,,2018,Nope
Danielson,It was good,,2018,
Battlefords,"It was great, the beaches were fantastic, our campsite was mostly quiet. Site was clean, and well maintained.",,2018,
Danielson,It was good.,,2018,
Duck Mountain,Ease of register and entry into park and site,,2018,
Moose Mountain,Everything went smoothly. It was hard to pick a site online that we knew we would fit into. Some leveling and extending of the sites is necessary,,2018,We camped at Murray Doell campground. Landscaping upgrades need to be made to accommodate the larger units that are camping. Also some leveling of sits. The boat launch needs some work as well. And more parking at the boat launch.
Greenwater,I always find the staff there very friendly and helpful!,,2018,
Cypress Hills,"nice private site, quiet and comfortable.",,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,Had a nice campsite. Friendly staff,,2018,
Battlefords,well the toilets were not clean and all ways seemed to be out of paper or plugged or out of order,,2018,
Greenwater,"Not happy with the campsite we were in. I know I picked it but when reserving was waiting long time and was kicked out of que. did not see alotvof park workers . This year water gross, not sure if from all the wake boats",Laundry service,2018,"I still love are parks, will continue to camp. Improvement would be nice. Some inforcement with boats that distroy are lakes would be nice. The beach at duck mountain in campground area needs maintenance"
Duck Mountain,Itâ€™s a very dirty campground. The boat launch was basically unusable. The showers were either cold or burning hot or had no pressure.,,2018,
Danielson,"Weren't able to get a site near the friends we camped with, despite waking up early on reservation launch day and using multiple computers",,2018,"It would really be great if there were some better way to book sites together with friends - side by side or nearby.  Even being able to put multiple bookings in your cart at once would help.    A way to trade sites might help too.    Also, sites that go unused should be given away after a certain amount of time if no one comes."
Moose Mountain,camp ground was quiet,,2018,The reservation system allows people to book multiple stays with the intent of only staying a few times and cancel at the last minute with minimal penalty.  when I book my sight there are very few campsites available and yet when i show up at the park most sites are empty because most people have cancelled for a $10 fee.  So i end up booking a smaller site than i require and during my stay the large sites sit empty as multiple people have cancelled.
Narrow Hills,Nice site,Pools or splash parks,2018,The need for more camp sites and larger ones for larger campers is needed. And more seasonal sites. I want a seasonal but never get one.
Narrow Hills,I enjoy the park and facilities.,,2018,
Great Blue,"Great service, clean campsites, clean beach, very helpful conservation officer",,2018,
Greenwater,It is such a popular camping destination that is highly sought after.  When I booked my site it was shortly after the reservation system opened that day and I was unable to book the site that I wanted although was able to take what was left over.,,2018,
22,"Lots of wasps , couldnâ€™ t get as many days as we wanted,",,2018,Would prefer that it was not all reserve a site because sites will be empty and you canâ€™t get in
Danielson,Did not enjoy the street lights; isnâ€™t this a dark sky preserve?,,2018,"Really enjoyed the Segway tour.  DID NOT ENJOY the streetlights at all & the outside lighting on the bathrooms is blinding & makes it hazardous & unsafe when trying to walk after dark. As a dark sky preserve, there should only be shielded, dim red or amber lights."
Danielson,The campsites werenâ€™t cleaned.   ESP once the fire ban went on.   We changed sites (poor booking service) and the whole time we were ther in 3 separate site no fire pits were cleaned out.  And two had garbage in them when we moved in.  One site was so uneven it took all our blocks to get the trailer close to even.,,2018,"We joined other family members and the organizing cousin was informed she would be able to book up to 5 sites when sites became available.  We thought this was great knowing that we have different sized units we would not be camped in a tight group but she would try to get us close so that people could walk to other sites etc easily.  Then when booking opened up she could not book for all so it was crazy trying to coordinate between lloydminster,   Regina, Edmonton, Medicine Hat and Calgary.  If we had know"
Meadow Lake,Got the site we wanted and had a good vacation,,2018,
Battlefords,Sites and public washroom facilities were well maintained,,2018,
Danielson,When trying to get a site. Is one of the worst days of my life!!!! I do not go on line line.  So there for I have to count on other people.   Itâ€™s a (terrible system).   Terrible.   And I my not alone with this problem!!!!   Need to change it,,2018,Need to change the booking system.    At least make it so u can book on the phone.   With in 5 minutes of on line booking or by phone. The sites r all booked so is pretty much impossible to get someone by phone.   What was wrong with the old way.  At least some sites.  Where u can just find a spot  go to office book
Duck Mountain,more parking by the boat lounch.  a BATHROOM by the boat lounch please,more parking by boat lounch. bathroom by boat lounch please,2018,parking by boat lounch more. bathroom by boat loucn by the fishing shack in thatarea would be nice so when you come in from fishing you have access to a washroom please
Moose Mountain,I would like to have cell phone coverage in the event of storms approaching,,2018,
22,because I was,,2018,
Battlefords,Because it is clean quite and we come evert year in August,,2018,
Danielson,"Because of the growing problem thats progressing over the years, all site are now being reserved on live.  For someone who lives not even two hours away a person canâ€™t even drive to the park now and get a decent site.   Maybe this is the direction the park wants to go but that affects people who live in the area, and people who enjoy this park,  there has to be a happy medium where are you not just catering to tourists who live further away, or those that have more money. This is supposed a pleasant get a",,2018,
22,We go every year but last two years I have been unable to book over July 1st weekend so we had to leave and try a different campground.,,2018,
Great Blue,Sites and fire pit were not cleaned out prior,,2018,
Danielson,It was a quieter time of year.,,2018,
Duck Mountain,"Quick check in, park was clean, beach was lovely, there was a few activities at the Info Centre (reptile show).  Such a beautiful park.",,2018,
Battlefords,"The Grass should of been cut all over the camp ground, and it was quite long. Trees need to be trimmed",,2018,
Moose Mountain,The Kimball Lake main shower house needs some renovation.,,2018,
Moose Mountain,"Lack of campsites, difficult to plan 4 months ahead, needs to be first come first serve 50% of the sites people who are not 9 to 5 and Monday to Fridayâ€™s with holidays can not book 4 months in advance and should have a fair opportunity to go camping.",Marinas,2018,
Battlefords,"There was not enough tree coverage in most of the camp sites, ours being one of the worst.  This mad it VERY hot during the day and there was not coverage from the wind storms at night.  There was also no showers and the bathrooms were quite a far walk away.  Would have been nice to have a shower area in this camp ground.  It would have also been nice to have more garbage and recycling available around the camp site.","Many things, this park and campsite did not have very much to offer.  Definately would like to see more acknowledgement of the treaty land and more indigenous art around.",2018,"Please try to include more indigenous art and acknowledgement within the Sask Parks.  It is so vital in Canada moving forward in Truth and reconciliation. Work with the indigenous communities around the park areas to instill proper and true knowledge within informative signs, exhibits, art, and more."
Buffalo Pound,The checkin is to long and in my mind does not have to be so complicated. maybe check out how Alberta does their reservation for a site.  Live in Lloydminster Alberta and would like to have a seasonal site,check alberta on line reservations and how to check in at park. a lot less fuss in Alberta's compared to Sskatchewan,2018,Would the province please fix highway 21 from Paradise Hill to Peck lake.    That is a disgrace!  It is very hard on camping Equipment!!!!!
Duck Mountain,Overall camping is great.  I wish the park was more dog friendly,,2018,
Buffalo Pound,PNA,PNA,2018,PNA
Danielson,We love camping  at Cypress.  We have been  camping  there  for 40 years,,2018,
22,Camp site had quite the slope to it and we had noisy neighbors one night. Otherwise it would have been perfect.,,2018,Our site at Pike lake was horrible.  We could not have a camp fire at all during our 5 night stay because the campers next to us had their trailer about 3 feet from our bbq fire pit.
22,overall the sites were very nice but lack some privacy from other campers because of the lack of smaller trees between sites,,2018,"The fire wood at Greenwater Provincial Park was absolutely terrible. It was mostly rotted. It has been this way for years. I wonder if the supplier of the wood for this park is related to government official, because it has been this way for years here but not at other parks we have stayed at in Saskatchewan."
Greenwater,Weather was terrible !,"Many people, including myself, like fall camping in September. Waskesiu leaves their shower houses open until Thanksgiving (weather permitting) so I go there. Also- why are the shower houses closed and locked all night? They should be left open except for cleaning.",2018,"When I look for a campsite on-line it shows very little or no availability but when I'm  there I always see lots of empty sites. I'm guessing people book online, pay and then don't show up. You need to better enforce your no-show policy and open up sites that aren't being used- it's frustrating not being able to get a site and yet they sit open and people get turned away."
Duck Mountain,cleanness,,2018,no
Duck Mountain,I think that the washrooms need to be updated.  Especially the outhouses.,More full serviced sites,2018,
Greenwater,We dealt with a storm that came through and caused damage.,,2018,

Meadow Lake,"upon arrival first day had a 2hr wait to get into site, previous tenants were in now hurry to leave  on or about 3rd day had boat covered and siting in the storage area when was vandalized and personal items stolen, was not the only boat affected, fire wood supplied was of good size 10-14 inch diameter  and always dry, we found cell phone reception has improved in area, road into park could use a little maintaining",,2018,
Moose Mountain,The group site is perfect for getting multiple families together with our own beach and communal campfire.  If this site had power it would be absolutely perfect!,,2018,Love the group campsite at Kimball. Have not been allowed to book for 2019 season so we are worried that we wonâ€™t get it. We and our friends have been going to kimball for many many years and find the group site the best for all of our children and grandchildren to get together. Would love to see power to these sites.
Greenwater,"The staff is helpful friendly smile the facility washroom  , shower beach all very clean. Feel safe both for the grandkids and the camper. No fire ban",,2018,
Crooked Lake,I camped in minowauka b and there are very few water taps to fill camper. It would be nice if there were more.,,2018,Please clean the beaches. They were a mess all year at candle lake. Not litter but reeds and lake roughage. All it would take is raking with a atv or small tractor.
Duck Mountain,"Nice area with swimming, hiking. Campground is decently maintained.",Stronger enforcement of fire bans,2018,Thanks for the opportunity to have a great camping experience!
22,"Check in attendant could have been friendly. We did not get a map of the park. When I asked for a map, I was told to google it. Cell phone reception was not good.",,2018,
Greenwater,Beautiful gems!! We have never been there and enjoyed our time there. Check in and amentities was a smooth/clean process!,,2018,
Moose Mountain,The development on the other side of lake (cabins) has impacted the number of people using the beach area.,,2018,The staff located in the booths for check-in and check-out are fantastic.  There was a problem with the online system during our stay and we wanted to check out early...because the systems were down the staff in the booths recommended we contact the online support.  The online support were not helpful at all.  Kept referring back to the website - I indicated it was down and couldn't access.  Not to mention I'm up in the middle of northern sask with no access to the internet (Sandy Beach).  In all honesty th
Rowans Ravine,"Shower houses could use some maintenance.   Broken handheld showerheads, nowhere to put shower supplies besides the floor in most stalls,  otherwise the park is great.",,2018,Just need better upkeep and maintenance to the showerhouses and bathrooms.
Candle Lake,"The pool at Buffalo Pound has always been a big reason why we loved camping there. After finding out that the pool had closed we decided to keep our reservation anyways. Since we were there during some of the hottest days of the summer we were going swimming in the lake quite a bit. After a few days both our kids developed swimmers itch from the water. Unless the pool reopens next summer, we will not be coming here again.",,2018,
Crooked Lake,"Site was clean, available on time, check-in staff was great.",Tent only areas.,2018,
Moose Mountain,The deadfall from the winds could have been cleaned up a lot of the picnic tables are in poor shape the online campaign booking of a site. (  The people that live next to the lake in Pierceland Donâ€™t have high speed Internet so booking this site is next to impossible you get what you get  if you get one ),,2018,We camp at sandy beach on Pierce lake I think that the people in Pierceland should have first pick over the sites at sandy beach.  We perfer sites that are close to the lake as we do lots of lake activity ( kayak paddle boarding tubing behind the boat ) we grew up at pierce lake sandy beach.  Ever since online reservations to place it extremely hard for locals to get a site next to the water with lots of toys that is a must
Good Spirit,Good service. Camp staff were helpful. Lots of wood. Beautiful location.,,2018,"Camp Easy site should have a long extension cord to reach to the plug in. Also, camp easy site would be well served with a small fridge."

Battlefords,Beautiful Park - great Marina and amenities,none that I can think of,2018,no thanks.
Lac La,All went well.  No issues. Really like the express self check in.  Like the fact that there is free firewood to  off set the price of the camping fees.,,2018,
Rowans Ravine,"Our first time to this park so we weren't sure what to expect. Unfortunately the pool was closed because it needed repairs and we were advised by friends who live in the area not to go in the pool. Other than that, we enjoyed the park. We went early in the season so there weren't a lot of people around, it was fairly quiet",More blue bins and ones that take more than just bottles and cans,2018,"I don't feel there is enough security presence. We were at one campground and the partying went on till all hours,  They weren't overly close to us, but close enough we could hear them. We were at a regional park where they enforced the rules and there was no loud noise after 11:00 pm.  Much more enjoyable camping experience"
Greenwater,"A lot of trees from the storm were still laying in the campsites, ours had an uprooted tree that left a large hole in the ground. With a young son and my toddler niece and nephew next to our site, we had to make sure they didnâ€™t fall in",Full service sites or increase RV dumping stations,2018,We love Murray point and weâ€™ve heard rumours of a clear out of trees to prevent more potentially falling during future storms. This is the allure of Murray point. We hope the fallen ones get cleaned up but the others remain!

Greenwater,No issues / problems at all.,,2018,
Danielson,I booked early but still could not get one campsite for the whole stay,,2018,
Good Spirit,majority of the time all was good  --- on ocasion the wood supply got really low -- had to go to the other camp area to get wood,small convience store --- fort quepplle is close however this would help,2018,not at this time
Lac La,"the golf course was not very friendly to work with,  this would be my 15th year going to green water and it has barely been upgraded or changed. ya some upgrading for the washrooms has been done but what about everything else? things to do",wood drop off,2018,"it seems like some parks are just getting left to fail, the pool closed at buffalo pound, green water is exactly the same there is no upgrades to the campsites yet every year travel trailors get bigger and nicer with more technology but the campsites stay the same. camp in the states or even in alberta there is wifi  our sask camp grounds are getting out dated  the fees keep going up but whats being offered stays the same  don't really seem fair does it?"
Blackstrap Provincial,Poor road conditions,internet access,2018,Cold September restricted plans to camp in September.
22,We always love our group camping spot at Battlefords,,2018,
Lac La,It was a good trip. Green Water is always nice.  But I should mention whoever runs the restaurant by the beach has some room for improvement. The food is pretty awful. Ice cream is good though for the most part.,,2018,"Keep up the good work! And also keep stocking green water with fish, we couldnâ€™t find many."
Moose Mountain,There was no mention of the  itch  in the lake. Two of my kids were severely effected. Also the beach at Kimball lake was filthy. I've been going for 15 years and I've never see it so bad. Also the sites were prone to flooding due to poor install of full service sites,,2018,I would like to see the beach cleaned every night and some effort put into maintaining bathrooms. Not just cleaning but fixing

Moose Mountain,Itâ€™s a nice park with nice staff. Wish there were more activities for children however and a better playground.,More acrivities in August,2018,How about you let Saskatchewan residents book before out of province residents.  And I donâ€™t see how some of these questions are pertinent to the success of the future of Saskatchewan parks.
Battlefords,Weather related!,,2018,Fire bans were an issue! Mother Nature at its finest!
Saskatchewan Landing,"Last spot available, dry wood harder to find",,2018,
Moose Mountain,Shower house was not completed for the summer months & we felt it should have been done before the season started,"No parking on roads in the campgrounds ,no pets",2018,All good except for the shower house not being done
22,We did enjoy our seasonal campsite. the only thing we did not like is that the water tap was right in front of our campsite so we had absolutely no privacy and when people went to get water they all just stared at us. So we  bought a see through black privacy material thing that was just to hang up that is specifically for privacy when your camping but we were told it had to come down cause they  cant see in our campsite ... well I call bull crap on that cause you could completely see in our campsite still!,,2018,no

Saskatchewan Landing,Water temperatures and pressure at service centre in Underwood was not good at all this year.,,2018,
Danielson,Because,Fishing information,2018,
Meadow Lake,It is a beautiful area--the only problem is that there should be more landscaping completed--trees should be trimmed so they don't rub on the motorhome when getting to the site-- the sites could be leveled better so you don't need a 1/2 ton of wood to drive onto so the unit is level and the dump station should be bigger to allow more than one person at a time to dump,more dumping stations; better access to garbage disposal--without having to stop on main road and cross traffic to throw trash away--when leaving there was no way to get motorhome in safe place to do this,2018,Boat launch parking needs work-- the use of the extra parking area up the road should be enforced  there needs to be a better site for garbage disposal-- when leaving we had no place to park other than on the main road to then go across the road to dispose of trash  the roads are terrible  trees should be trimmed so they don't cause damage when driving along the interior roads  the sites should be leveled so you don't need boards under the tires to be level  there needs to be an additional dump site for bla
Danielson,We go camping there every year and they have something for everyone.,,2018,This summer trip to Cypress was the only trip I felt unsafe. There were people squealing tires in the middle of the night and there were people walking around at night attempting to steal coolers!

Moose Mountain,Other people's dogs were off leash constantly a family member was bit by a dog that wasn't leashed. We had 2 dogs come into our campsite. It was scary walking our 2 leashed dogs in the park as several times we had to carry our dogs as we were approached by dogs not leashed and thought we were gonna get bit and our dogs attacked. If your gonna have a rule that dogs need to be on a leash then you need to enforce it and have consequences if people aren't following the rules. It's not fair to the responsible pe,,2018,
Good Spirit,Very good washroom facility.  Even the outhouse was good.  Clean camp site.,Guided tours of local historical sites.,2018,"Need more ways to ensure all campers are not abusing the commons.  There are still people who run their loud generators.  There was an RV 50 meters away that ran their generator for at least an hour late at night.

Or signs encouraging people to report high use of generators and music etc."
Danielson,Tons of Wasps in campsite made it difficult to be outside.  Washrooms were a long ways away. First campsite was very bush-like and did not look like the pictures.,,2018,"While I appreciate that Cypress Park is a natural and protected environment, the lake there is disgusting.

Greenwater,Itâ€™s always nice and clean and everybody is helpful and friendly,,2018,
Danielson,We always love our camping trips tips to Cypress Hills.  We have gone every year for about 14 years. We used to stay for 2 weeks.  Our only frustration now is with trying to book a site.,,2018,Cypress Hills is a top notch park.  We have also been to Buffalo Pound.  Not a fan of the pool rules there as they didn't allow snacks in the pool grassy area like they do at Cypress.  It's very difficult to get a site now at Cypress so we have pretty much given up after years of camping there with our kids as they grew up.  We just try to find a couple of open days as summer gets closer and try to make it work now.
Narrow Hills,People  not using the site altho there was a camper there and no one around.   Trailers  sat empty for 4 or 5 days during the week.  The park is not being fully used.,Make sure people are in campsite  not just parking their camper,2018,no

Makwa,nemeiben lake is great.,ability to cam at a park without having to reserve it.  not all of us can plan our holidays months in advance,2018,there should be a way to make sure campsites are available for people who cannot plan their vacations months in advance.  since this reserve system it's ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS to have to stay in the crappy sites when there are good sites open.  someone obviously reserves them and then doesn't come to stay at them.  so then I have to stay in an non electric or far away from the boat launch.   if you book the sites and then don't show up.  either call in and let saskparks know you aren't staying or you should

Great Blue,Park is always making improvements  every year. Beautiful  beach,,2018,

Danielson,Pleasant staff - However the sewer dump station is terrible and is likely a serious liability risk to the Province - dirty unkept exposed bolts that are a hazard - really needs to be looked at.,"Sewer dump is atrocious.  It is dirty, poor design and has safety risks with exposed bolts trip hazards and no concrete skirt do collect extra sewer dropped.  Both are Very bad",2018,"Normally we can book group camp a year and even two years ahead,  This year there is no ability to do this which causes serious problems in planning our event which we have done for 30 some years.  They will give no ability to book into 2019 and advise their is no process.  Also Cypress Hills has eliminated several group camps and converted them to multi year seasonal leases.  This is a disgrace to what provincial parks are supposed to be."
Duck Mountain,Boat lauch isnt working most of time doesnt seem there is any desire to fix the problems,Full service,2018,Someone use  there brain power to figure out how to keep douglas park boat lauch operating year to year
Battlefords,most things were good. Fire Ban prevented us from having camp fires at the end of that week and we try to cook all our meals on the fire.,,2018,"the $30/ night is ok when everything is included. But when the fire ban goes on and you don't have access to fire wood or the trails are closed, $30 is expensive. Also alot of the paved roads inside Sask Landing are in desperate need of repair. Most things were acceptable while we were there this year. Not sure about the Park Ranger though."
Saskatchewan Landing,"The park is clean, the staff were friendly and helpful. There was plenty to do walking trails, boating,  fishing.

Rowans Ravine,Sites were a decent size and clean.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.      I donâ€™t like the pedestal style fire pits.

Lol and I would like to know what in cypress for winter activities for families
Danielson,Customer service was good and polite.,,2018,Please make changes to the reserve a site. I believe it is flawed and needs adjusting. People that book a week should have to pay for that week unless they don't show at all. Because people are booking the whole week calling two days before to cancel the weekday anD just come out for the weekend. Leaving that site empty all week long. Change has to happen to make sure the sites are full and being used as intended. Thank you

They should have to be in there site for at least 75% of the time they have it booked for. Yes the site has a camper in but the park isnâ€™t making money if the people arenâ€™t actually there to spend money.

I was under the understanding that a camper and one tent is aloud on one site. There was several tents and several families there.

Douglas Provincial,The park itself is finally getting some improvements but not nearly enough. We have been camping at Danielson for over 30 years. The road into the gate entry has finally had some  of the potholes filled in but needs more. The building which used to serve as the park offices etc is in a terrible state and should either be painted or torn down completely.  Itâ€™s a disgrace to look at and Parks shd be embarrassed! It would seem that Danielson is last on the list to receive improvements. Douglas Park has a new,Pike lake has wash basins with soap outside the bathrooms which is really great.

Danielson,"Lovely park, so much to offer. Activities and wildlife food and accommodation.  It has it all.",,2018,"I prefer the reservation system in Alberta, as it is 90 days prior. It's so much easier to book only 90 days ahead rather than so far in advance.  Also the way it works people cant book all the weekends through a summer leaving people having to move their camper if they want more than 5 days in a row. I feel it's a better system and I seem ho be able to get a site easier so even though I'm 20 min from Cypress I have to go to Alberta to get a vacant site."

When the fire ban was lifted we had to go get firewood ourselves from the woodpile that they temporarily had in Shady Lane. This seemed to be an overreaction by the park as we were seasonal and we were going to be there when the fire ban was lifted.

It seemed like the details were missed this summer - broken water balloons on the site when we arrived, washrooms needed cleaning, and fire pits were not scooped out fully.

Moose Mountain,"being camping there for thirty years, don't like the reserve site system at all like a lot of other people. Also have being trying to get seasonal site with no success",,2018,Love the parks and fishing
Meadow Lake,"Noisy neighbors, only one sewer dump, safety of the wood pile",Grocery store,2018,"Please work on the parking situation at Makwa, people are damaging the habitat and you can't get through!"
Crooked Lake,"Good campsite, nice and clean, good wood supply excellent gate person squirrels quite friendly ha, ha,",,2018,Shower house at Candle Lake Provincial park-Minowuka needs refurbishing

Greenwater,"The campsite was well looked after, we were close to the lake, the playground was close as well as showers etc.      the weather was great!!!",,2018,
Battlefords,"I enjoy camping at the landing and we have been doing so for years.  The only thing I would like to see is a dog designated dog park or two.  This year was the worst I have seen for people not picking up after their pets, often because they don't want to walk to the garbage bins placed outside the main areas.  It was disgusting.  They would also let their pets urinate on trees right beside peoples picnic tables while people were eating which was really revolting.  There were also owners using the public was",Dog park designated areas,2018,
Danielson,Cypress is a beautiful place to camp,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,The bathroom doors were terrible and kept locking automatically.  Very frustrating having to find staff to unlock them consrsntly,We really miss the daily activities for kids,2018,Please bring back the programming for kids
Moose Mountain,Store closed. No activities available to do. No ice cream store. Nithing available to rent. Even at end of season had to buy a full season pass. Cost of season pass out to lunch.,,2018,"As we were there at the end of August to September it was very disheartening to find the store, rental facilities and ice cream stand CLOSED.  Should not matter that the store is privately run - the park is open so should she be."
Duck Mountain,no problems,,2018,no
Narrow Hills,Knm,,2018,Loved the interpretive programs for me and the boys.
Meadow Lake,Bathrooms were not cleaned properly several days plus ran out of tissue several days. Park security hardly ever drove by during the week and only a couple times a day on weekends which we feel  Isn't sufficient,,2018,In our opinion there should be someone that checks whether the park maintenance workers and office staff are doing there jobs !
Candle Lake,no notification of boat launch closure in sept.,,2018,
Cypress Hills,"We had a good spot, the wood pile had wood and it was a nice weekend.",More single shower buildings like at Clear Lake or Melville Regional Park.  The bathrooms need to be a little cleaner.  If we are continuing to hire students then they need to do a better job.,2018,Yes.  I wished you would have asked me about Good Spirit where we spent two weeks.  That park is totally disgusting now and has gone downhill.  The Manager is doing a terrible job managing the park and needs  To be replaced with someone who is interested in making that park beautiful again.  The campsite we stayed in you could see your neighbor and the highway.  Trees have not been replanted and need to be!  When trees die you need to replant!  The bathroom was so disgustingly dirty and got cleaned properly
Narrow Hills,Over all great experiance.,,2018,
Makwa,Okay,Swimming pool,2018,
Narrow Hills,Just was,,2018,
Lac La,All around great camping experience,,2018,
Cypress Hills,VERY NICE PLACE TO CAMP,Need more camping site. There is to many camper out there,2018,You need more camping site so we can go camping more. Most camping site are booked right up. Sad when we have to look for camping sites else were.
Meadow Lake,i lived in sask all my life and have camped every year. but is so disappointing when you go to the troubles of booking on line and you are told everything is booked but in realitly there are site not occupiyed because of the screwed up system i am totally not impressed and i do hope that something wil change. maybe a 50/50 spilt 50% book and 50% first come first serve. i never went camping this year because on line it said all was full in makwa and meadow lake park but yet we drove threw some sites and ther,throw out the way you have to book a site,2018,on line booking sucks
Narrow Hills,I really enjoyed the walking trails they are keep up great. I really enjoy Moose Mountain it is a well keep park!,,2018,
Greenwater,Have always loved Anglin Lake and the staff do a great job of ensuring there is wood and everything is kept clean.,,2018,"As usual, our time at Anglin was wonderful and peaceful."
Great Blue,Fun with friends decent weather quality family time,,2018,
Lac La,"We arrived in the evening to set up but decided to return home instead. Most of the stay was going to be my daughter and myself. The full service site I reserved a week prior was not suitable for the following reasons. Our first concern was with the site being on a hill and the safety of our 22 month old. In my opinion, the site should not even exist due to slope and location. Secondly, we could not get our camper level without the back hanging over the edge of the hill.  Our camper was within the camper si",,2018,Iâ€™m aware of the importance of keeping the natural elements of the campsites and appreciate the natural beauty. The water/sewer sites at Greenwater provincial park appear to messy due to the weeds that surround the sites that are not in the trees. It also maybe a good idea to plants trees on the sites that are open.
Lac La,"Nice treed in sites, lots of privacy.",,2018,
Meadow Lake,The public washroom/shower houses weren't clean any of the times we went up.  We ended up just using our travel trailer to shower in instead.  A second shower house would be very beneficial for such a large park as Makwa as well.,,2018,
Duck Mountain,Love Duck Mountain Park. We ensure we go once a year to take in the beautiful lake.,,2018,Camping and Park fees are substantially higher than Manitoba for no better services. Next year we will not be purchasing an annual pass since we live so close to Manitoba border. We will still take our annual fishing and camping trip to Madge which is the gem of campgrounds in Saskatchewan.
Danielson,We have camped there for many years. It is our favorite place. It offers a variety of activities to satisfy everyone.,Fitness circuit park,2018,"They need more benches at playgrounds for guardians to watch their children.     Better signage on trails with info like distance, rating of difficulty etc."
Cypress Hills,"The sites condition when we arrived was....disgusting.  I had to clean up dead jack fish parts, dental floss picks, dog leashes, beer cans, ear plugs, ropes, plastics of many varieties, dog poop, bones from steak or some kind of ribs that had just been discarded on the ground, and there were beer boxes in the fire pit.  It was terrible.",Perhaps a small convenience store in the park?  I'm not sure where it would fit though.,2018,The ratings in this survey are specific to my experience at Crooked Lake Provincial Park and do not reflect my experiences in the other parks I have stayed in.    Also I would like to add that I would prefer to see more parks in Southern Sask keep their electricity on well into November as I very much enjoy camping late into the fall.  Having at least 110v electricity is needed to run the furnace in my travel trailer for a 3-day stay.  For instance I have just stayed at Moose Mountain in the second weekend
Duck Mountain,The biggest plus to this visit was the quality of the firewood!  Really appreciate the new trailer dumping station and running water in the outhouses.  The new management of the store and its development is a VERY welcome event.  Only criticism is the potholes on some of the campground roads. :(,,2018,
22,"The campsite and area was beautiful and we were very satisfied with it, however the beach area with all the Goose droppings will keep us from returning. We were travelling with a young family and certainly did not feel comfortable with the children walking, and playing in the sand which was full of the droppings. Even walking in the grass area close to the beach and playground was extremely bad. I realize this is nature however it will stop us from returning to your beautiful park!",,2018,
Duck Mountain,"The amount of barking dogs, made certain times at the lake not enjoyable.  I called and complained, suggested that the staff walk around the bays (instead of driving with windows up) and when they heard dogs barking, give owners warnings/discipline. A lot of people walk, some with dogs.  When a dog sees another dog or a stranger they bark.  Dog owners are some of the most inconsiderate people, no concerns to others with noise or not cleaning up.",a better booking system,2018,Please enforce better dog policing
Blackstrap Provincial,nice park close to citu,a store,2018,
Greenwater,The site in North Murray point is very private.,,2018,"I was disappointed in the ads for Fall Camping as they did not provide the correct information.  I love fall camping; however, it was difficult to find parks that actually had sites available with power.  I had to call individual provincial parks to find these things out.  It would be nice if they truly offered Fall Camping past September 30th with Electrical Sites."
Candle Lake,Everything was fine but it would be much easier and produce less car traffic if the campfire wood was not so far away now.,Easier to access firewood,2018,
Makwa,Great camping at Nemeiben. We love the lake,,2018,Enjoy the parks.
Rowans Ravine,The actual lake was disgusting. The staff at the entrance gate where less than helpful or knowledgeable for directions to site.,,2018,Overly satisfied with all parks we visited. Some facilities are dated but still functional which is the most important
Moose Mountain,Because it is so beautiful. My favourite place to vacation,,2018,Wish there were more full service sites - sewer/water
Duck Mountain,Some of the sites could use a little bit of work. Leveling the gravel for easier camper setup.,,2018,"The sewer unload spot at Duck Mountain park has a good number of spots but the area is in absolutly terrible condition. The hoses leaked everywhere, the ground is extremely unlevel and I could not completely empty my camper. It's been like this for a long time as I come to this park lots. This area needs attention ASAP!"
Narrow Hills,The park was clean well-maintained the sites were good everything was very satisfactory,,2018,
Candle Lake,park staff does nothing for campers anymore.  Cant rate service because there was none,,2018,"The online booking system is crazy.  People log onto multiple computers and it is ridiculous.  I would like to see Sask Residents get first pick.  Design system so that you need to enter your health number, not hard to do on a computer program.  I am all about tourism but we need to remember that our tax dollars hugely subsidize our parks... for alberta.  if you camp at Kimball it is over half alberta licence plates while our sask residents could not get sites.  This is just wrong!"
Battlefords,Beautiful location with great facilities. Sites nice and large.,Booking no more than 90 days in advance.,2018,The online booking system is extremely frustrating. 90 days in advance is much more sensible.
Candle Lake,Very clean park.,Enclosed dog park,2018,
Lac La,The only confusing part at check in that there is no campground office any longer. That was not explained we ended up driving around the park a little,,2018,
Battlefords,We were able to relax and also enjoy the park and the other campers,,2018,
Danielson,Managed to book a suitable sight this time.,,2018,Having to book so far in advance in an attempt to secure an acceptable site for more than a very few days takes away much of the enjoyment of camping. A 2 week stay in the same campsite is a challenge.
Narrow Hills,"I thought it was a great park, love free fire wood, the bathrooms were a little gross for my liking, the playground is awesome, wouldnâ€™t mind a couple more benches for parents to sit at",,2018,
Moose Mountain,Staff were very unfriendly and rude,,2018,Most unfriendly and unwelcoming to out of province guests.  Makes it hard to consider returning.  No information given at the park booth. Not even a map.
Pike Lake,Good staff,,2018,"Please designate 50% to  first come, first served"
Saskatchewan Landing,"Good site, clean, level and lots of room.",Plenty of room for a pool.,2018,Please fix the road out to Rowan's.
Pike Lake,No internet,We would LOVE to have electricity in the group site at Douglas Prov Park or at least at the common kitchen.,2018,"RE: Douglas Prov Park. Our family (extended) stay at the group site every summer...at least 50 people. We have used the group site for 8 summers now and there has been members of the family that have reported issues regarding the bathrooms. No change. The ladies washroom are not up to par. One of them the door doesn't close properly, the solar lights don't work, and there are bats. It would be great if there could be electricity in the group site or at least in the kitchen. It's difficult to make a meal for"
Crooked Lake,Spots wer large and free wood showers and washrooms need to be open according to times posted not 30 minutes later in mornings,All other parks we've stayed in Alberta and into the United States have. Wifi. The cell service is extremely poor. 99% of the time you have no service.  For a provincial park should have better service.,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,"We apply for a seasonal every year but weâ€™re not drawn this year.  We booked in the non maximum stay sites for May to Beginning of August.  We love being at the beautiful lake, most campsites are nice and it is generally kept clean.",Year round seasonal sites,2018,
Narrow Hills,we had a good time,,2018,make the the pass words work
Narrow Hills,There was a very loud group beside us who the park staff did not stop from being loud. We didnâ€™t report it however it was clear that staff werenâ€™t patrolling,The dog restrictions within the beach/park area were really restrictive. Our friends went to the beach and we werenâ€™t even allowed on the grass but there are no places to sit that arenâ€™t on grass,2018,
Great Blue,Facilities are good and well maintained.,,2018,
Meadow Lake,"Good site , fairly quite , too many dogs",A few more bigger sites,2018,
22,Itâ€™s a nice park and we had fun,,2018,There are too few non electric sites for people who are camping in a tent and donâ€™t need an electrical site. There should be an option to reserve an electrical site at the non electric rate if you arenâ€™t going to use the electricity. The parks are very biased towards big trailers and are starting to not be tent-friendly.
Danielson,"4 or 5  years ago sask gov wanted to let in sask campers first , than other other campers from other provinces like alberta. we caused a lot of commotion they changed the system. now you are  in a que.  three of us couples went in the que, we are always at about 3000 to 4000 in the que. because we know how the system works now, if you have a alberta ip address. you go back of the line. we have been coming there for about 25 years , but now we get  the crap spots that are left. also years ago  anyone one wit",BE FAIR TO ALL CAMPERS NOT JUST SASK RESIDENTS.,2018,"we are waiting for sask gov to change there system so it is fair for alberta residents to camp there, not in que 3000 to 4000  every year. they want our money but only as a last resort if there are  is anything available after sask residents get first pick."

Greenwater,"The sites were beautiful, bath houses were extremely clean, lovely maintained walking trails",,2018,
Duck Mountain,"Too many dogs, did not get a good idea of what the campsite looked like because there were only 2 pics of it on the reservation site and these did not give a good sense of what the site was like.  This meant that the tent we had wanted to erect for our grand kids could not be used",,2018,"Dog control needs to be increased.  Speed control within campsite areas needs to be improved.  Rules on number of camping units, cars people needs to be enforced.  Parking of boats should not be allowed in campsite because the size and cost of modern RV's makes them hazards.  Management of parks should be required to make daily visits to parks to ensure they are run properly.  Maintenance/janitorial staff need to have their work inspected way more often (I don't think it is ever done).  Disabled shower faci"
Saskatchewan Landing,we had power plug pulled during night and some teenagers gave a bit of hard time,docks for small craft,2018,don't be so nosy

Great Blue,"I HATE the booking system.  I want to book a site for more than 14 days... I should be able to!  Let's say I have two weeks off - I want to book the first weekend, and the whole two weeks and the last weekend.  But your stupid rules don't allow that.  I want a 16 night stay but it will bump me right out and I have to start again.  AND so you take a two day booking from someone that will screw up the middle of my two weeks off!  So now I'd have to move twice.  What about having some type of booking staggered","campers are getting bigger, so accessability to some sites is a challenge. Drive through parking?",2018,"I think that the seasonal  lottery  system is a failure, totally flawed!  If I don't get a seasonal, I want to book long term stays.  But if I have to move my camper lots, then I think it is time to look somewhere else... There are so many PRIVATE options at Good Spirit.  I think that this booking system has created it's own issue.  People need options! and this system doesn't give me any freedom."
22,"We find this campground convenient, clean, well maintained and just a nice place to enjoy.","Full service sites with water, sewer and electricity.",2018,We would like to see the boat launch upgraded and more fresh water outlets closer to the sites.
Danielson,We love Cypress. Many fun things to do with the family including quiet nature walks. Great location and experience every year for the past 12 years.,,2018,
Moose Mountain,"The lack of being able to get a choice in what site to pick, it almost seems like itâ€™s in Alberta cause there are very few sask campers there",,2018,Sask residents should have first opportunity to book camp sites before out of province residents
Candle Lake,We were bothered by the Camp host . He never once came to say what was happening in the park. Only came and told us what we couldnâ€™t do. Leaving notes when we left our site.  I canâ€™t believe he got a free site to be a camp cop  He was so annoying and his wife too. It was like they spyed on everyone.   Weâ€™ve camped there for years and never had problems.   I think the wood pile up top is silly. And waiting for a broken wagon to pull wood to your truck was crazy. It seems every year thereâ€™s some new r,A new swimming pool  and easier access to wood pile,2018,Reevaluate the camp host. Not needed  Put the wood back in piles by campsites  It seems that the same people get drawn for season sites every year. I know people that get it all the time and others never    Need to water everywhere  the campsites at maplevale and trail send need watering   Need a new swimming pool  Beaches need grooming and new sand

Duck Mountain,The park is well maintained and has enough amenities and activities for our family. The new visitor centre is beautiful!,,2018,
Moose Mountain,We stayed at a non-electric campsite (Mistohay) with most campers running generators at different times and some running almost all day long.  It was not very relaxing.,Limited specific times for running generators as in National Parks. ie. 9:00 am - 10:00 am and 4:00 pm - 5:00 pm only,2018,

Saskatchewan Landing,Would have preferred a seasonal site but didnâ€™t get drawn again.,,2018,Repair the roads to Rowanâ€™s!
Danielson,"The site wasn't great but all we could get even though we tried to reserve early on the day that CHIP opened for reservations. Would say that process for when parks are open for reservations could be improved (ex., AB staggers theirs as well to avoid overloading the system but instead can only reserve 90 days in advance which seems to provide more options/availability). The park itself is now so crowded that it's becoming more like camping in a parking lot. Perhaps some campsites designated for smaller RVs",More information on ecosystem services. More information/programs on 'forest bathing' or mental health benefits of nature.,2018,"With respect to Cypress Hills (centre block), don't sacrifice a unique and delicate ecosystem in order to accommodate yet more and more people. It's an area of natural wonder and its preservation should be a priority over short-term user satisfaction. Would suspect the park is over carrying capacity for recreation and have seen over the years huge changes to the natural environment there, and not good ones. Someone might have to stand firm and say no to more development."
Great Blue,The electrical in the group site is central so cords required all around covered area. Floor in covered area very unlevel and shifted. Holes in ground around covered area.Garbage cover not very secure but they did pick up regular. Just concerned about evening garbage attracting wildlife. No running water to wash hands in washroom. We were pleased to have one flush toilet. Area and sites did seem well groomed and site is private and quiet.,,2018,

When they saw that I noticed the phone/camera, they disappeared. The parks staff did their best to resolve the situation, as best there could.",Full hookups,2018,
Battlefords,Bathroom facilities are becoming subpar and are in need of update,,2018,
Buffalo Pound,I love that Bronson is small and lots of lake per site.,,2018,I appreciate all the work that goes into maintaining the parks and thank everyone involved for keeping our beautiful parks clean and useable!
Battlefords,Starting to get a little too expensive to camp,,2018,
22,"The grounds were kept clean.  Grass was cut.  Sites were clean. Actually, thinking about it now, the lodge was very noisy into the night and caused sleep troubles for our group",More interpretive programs for children,2018,
Meadow Lake,beautiful country and lake,,2018,
Great Blue,The camp site was dirty. The fire pit was very broken and should have been fix before we got there. The campground was not full and we should have gone to a different site. But the office seemed to not care that we were happy. The garbage location is terrible. There needs to be more cans with in walking distance even if it's at the shower house or small cans like it used to be in the campsite area,,2018,

Greenwater,There were many activities for the kids to participate in.  This is our favourite campground so far.,In park concession for the kids to go buy treats,2018,Absolutely Amazing!  No complaints
Danielson,"Lots of activities in the park. Golfing, swimming, hiking, geocaching, zip lining, bike trails.     We did have 3 concerns during our stay.     Staff at the visitor centre used to be very knowledgeable and friendly and we have found the past 2 years the level of service has dropped. Employees donâ€™t seem to know the park very well.     The fire ban was also dissapointing but understandable.     The biggest concern is that we visited during the sask summer star party and found that this group took over Mead",Liquor vendor,2018,The booking system doesnâ€™t seem adequate. We had 2 computers ready when camping opened and we were 600 and 1200 in line. We were not able to book any of the 12 spots we had hoped to book. It seems almost impossible to book the sites you want. We also find that majority of sites are not large enough for a 35 foot fifth wheel. Consideration of the average size of trailers should be given when developing new sites.
Duck Mountain,There was a bear at the park during our visit which  took away from the enjoyment.,,2018,
Greenwater,"We are Saskatchewan residents who camp 60+ nights every year, but rarely win a seasonal site, and in 2017 when we did at candle lake we were next to a slew. We watch the seasonal sites sit empty and wonder why we pay the same price for half the camping. I realize itâ€™s a draw, but maybe looking at how many nights the person has booked prior could be a consideration.",,2018,
Rowans Ravine,"Overall experience was great. It was a bit unfortunate that the water sports rental place had some specific units that were broken, not available to rent that week. I wished the firewood was available after 9pm as well.",,2018,
Makwa,"Beautiful scenery, even with the fire damage...educational for the kids.",,2018,
Lac La,Your online booking system is completely unfair system to the people that live outside of Saskatoon or Regina due to internet speeds. and the government would not even hand out flyers at the entry booth to help support the people that put on the annual fireworks that is completely no cost to the taxpayers,,2018,Get rid of your online booking system. I have not been able to book a site when I wanted to take my holidays. I have to always change my holiday dates    Make a fair booking system for everyone. Frustrating to see other provincial plates get campsites and I canâ€™t get one first!!
Moose Mountain,Kimball lake site was on a hill couldn't level our unit probably   Sandy beach needs lots of work bumpy roads trees all over beach dirty run down playground crappie wood,Cleaning the beach and campsites,2018,Sandy beach really needs some upgrades

Cypress Hills,been there before nice quiet campground,,2018,no
Blackstrap Provincial,It would be nice to have the concession open,Make sure there are non-electric sites,2018,Disappointed that there were no non-electric sites at Greenwater and had to pay for electricity we did not use.
Rowans Ravine,It's just so easy! Is perfect for families. We love the parks and trails are great for young kids! We tried a few of the back packs the last time we went and the were really fun! A few of the parts needed to be replaced but other then I love this park for a quick weekend a way.,Full service sites,2018,Keep up the great work! I love the free fire wood and clean grounds !
Saskatchewan Landing,"Park is well cared for, good amenities, we were able to book a nice, private site.",Covered wood supply.,2018,"The old-style pedestal BBQ's are in pretty rough shape in some parks (uneven, rusted). More parks could use a shelter for their firewood (simple roof such as Duck Mountain PP). Can be tough to get a fire going when you show up after days of rain. The possibility of no dry wood also encourages people to bring in outside wood. Also, we noticed that when booking our reservation at Rowan's Ravine, virtually the entire campground was shown as already booked for the time we were looking, but during our stay, many"
Pike Lake,no particular reason,,2018,"As a person whom does a lot of driving around Saskatchewan, it appalls me that a lot of the highways that lead  to provincial parks are among the worst in the province.. I would also like to see the reservation date changed   back to Jan 1 like it was years ago.  The current method and date leaves more than just a little bit to be desired.  We would do a lot more camping if our dates were available without having to get up at 6:00am and finding out  you are selection number 1500 before you get a chance to b"

Duck Mountain,"OK check-in thought the staff was pretty disengaged, bathrooms fairly well maintained but ran out of things several times",Option to not pay for an electrified site in an area I want to camp in but will never use power,2018,I've been camping at Duck Mountain for years and the firewood is always terrible. Like to the point that it's a running joke between campsites to get and keep fires going. Always green and/or wet. Need to service the bathrooms more often.
Duck Mountain,i am crippled and can only walk so much. also the people running the store at pickeral point are charging horrific rates for their goods. 4bucks is out of line for a litre of milk.,,2018,no
Candle Lake,"The wood was well stocked, the bathrooms were clean and the camp ground was quiet.",,2018,
Danielson,Everything was very good,,2018,
Meadow Lake,"Camping was good however it is getting increasingly dangerous to be out on or in the water, especially in a canoe. Wakeboard boaters are very careless with their huge wakes and are often not watching where they are going or where their giant wake is headed.  There should be no boating activity at all in the bay where the swimming area is, the wakes from these boats are just too much & the stereos are obnoxious.",,2018,It would be great if Saskatchewan residents were offered an earlier chance to book as well as park passes & camping fees at a reduced rate! ?
Great Blue,The campsite wasn't the best.,,2018,

Moose Mountain,We stayed at Sandy beach (Piercelake) and they are in desperate need of a new playground. I would not let my son play at the playground there. Which was a Shame,Newer safer playgrounds,2018,I feel I canâ€™t mention enough the huge need for an updated safer playground at Sandy Beach
Duck Mountain,"Good campsite, happy with the amenities in the park.",,2018,
Crooked Lake,"Would have been more satisfied if the washrooms were cleaner, more showers and less dog crap all over.",,2018,
Blackstrap Provincial,"There was significant garbage that had been left there. Some of the garbage was clearly over a year old. There were also old tent poles that had been discarded as well as beer cans, broken glass and bottle caps. Gross and unsafe for my children","Cleanliness, maintenance",2018,I was just so disappointed in the cleanliness of the park. It didnâ€™t seem like anybody does any cleaning in those walk in sites especially considering the amount of garbage that I picked up (a full garbage bag plus 4xlarge steel pipes). I highly doubt that I will go back because I can find cleaner campsites elsewhere
Duck Mountain,Was not a lot of programming when we went at end of August,,2018,
Duck Mountain,Loved the park! Great facilities!,,2018,"Need a pool at Buffalo Pound provincial park, as it draws a lot of people to come to the park."
Blackstrap Provincial,"Enjoyed the park. There was a boil water advisory on, and the first time we booked we cancelled because I am auto-immune depressed.  We booked again. No warnings on the web, but there still was a boil water advisory. This posed a health risk to me.",,2018,
Battlefords,Easy to book a site and the site was excellent,,2018,I didnâ€™t see any questions on cypress hills provincial park. We really love that park.
Duck Mountain,Nice private sites.  Good amenities.,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,Nice clean bathroom facilities with flush toilets and sinks to wash hands - always a plus with small children!!,"More family friendly showers - my boys are too young to shower on their own on the mens side, but also getting a little bit older that its weird for them to go in the women's washrooms sometimes. Family friendly facilities would be nice.",2018,Kimball Lake really needs to improve its main shower house and bathroom facilities around the campsites.  It is far behind the Saskatchewan Landing and Rowans Ravene on this front.
Blackstrap Provincial,Too open no trees. Was no one even at the gates to tell us where to find our site. Finally found a conservation officer and was told all funding was cut so not many staff working. Bathrooms kinda dirty.,More parks with pools,2018,Need more full service sites at all parks.

Great Blue,"People still bring their dogs to the beach in the evening. Also, there is a lot of dog poop on the paths.",Better bathrooms,2018,I only wish that the bathroom facilities were better at Good Spirit and that people would follow the rules that apply to their pets.

Candle Lake,To hard to get a sight,,2018,No
Crooked Lake,There were no enough facilities for the number of campers I.e bathrooms and showers. Also each camp site had too many extra vehicles. Likely an average of 4 per site.,,2018,
Narrow Hills,they had improved some of the outdoor toilets but they were hardly ever cleaned . No toilet paper was replaced but no one swept the floor or washed the walls.,outdoor washing facilities at the outdoor toilets,2018,A system should be established so more sites should be able to be reserved for longer than 2 weeks without having issues with those that only want to book for weekends. Too bad so many people book seasonal sites and then yr more about the annual seniors free permit.
Makwa,most of the time I was wilderness camping and not dependent on amentites of established campgrounds.The established campgrounds that I stayed at had limited services - which is just fine with me,,2018,"As a minimalist camper, I need fewer services, not more. And given the low impacy way I choose to camp - in a tent, with a canoe, my footprint on the park, on the environment is soooo much smaller than those hauling the trailer and the power boat(s). I find it offensive that my campsite fee is the same as those who have a much larger footprint  on the park and the environment. Charge people for wood so if they want a bonfire all day long they can pay for it too. Charge people for axles that they haul into t"
Candle Lake,The garbage disposals were not located anywhere close to the sites. Which left most sites to place bins out on their own sites that were full and attracted plenty of rodents eating through the bags and scattering garbage everywhere.,,2018,
Battlefords,Lots of great activities. Clean facilities. Lots to do.,,2018,Reserve a site website is super frustrating. This system needs to be looked at. So hard to book and then sites sit empty.
Moose Mountain,Try to reserve a site is brutal then while you are up there you see the sites you would have liked stay open all week. Should be like a hotel reservation . If you donâ€™t show up you get charged and it opens up to be rented again,Group camp with electricity,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,Our sight g had not been cleaned when we got there!beer bottles caps and cigarette butts not cleaned up and fire pit full of ash,,2018,
Meadow Lake,I would like to be able to book for the month,,2018,"I used to camp at Stabler every year for 2 months. We were forced to buy a lot on Makwa and drive to Stabler for lessons due to the online booking system and cap on reservation time. Iâ€™m very disappointed, I wish we were still camping there more."
Candle Lake,"The pool is broken, not much for kids to do out there. We gone to buffalo pound for over 30 years and if the pool doesn't get fixed. We'll probably never go back.",All Saskatchewan money for camping parks goes everywhere eles but into buffalo pound. Put in a new pool and water park for families,2018,Put the fire wood back to where it was. Add a new pool and splash pad. Have both so pool isn't over packed. Add more to do.
Great Blue,"We love camping at Good Spirit. We always camp in the overflow area. We have more room for our camper and boat and itâ€™s easier with 2 dogs.  Itâ€™s often pretty quiet out there as well.  We do run a generator for power and have to overnight but unless itâ€™s abnormally busy, this doesnâ€™t bother anyone!  (We need power overnight for health reasons).   Our only concerns are the water level of the lake and the highway condition driving in.  Sure wish they wouldnâ€™t drain the lake in the spring!",,2018,I wouldâ€™ve liked to camp at Moose Mountain but could never get a site.  I wish they had a better overflow area.  It would need to be larger and a little more accessible for campers.
Rowans Ravine,good experience all in all,,2018,

One dog-friendly water area was ok, but it was not possible for us to watch the kids at the beach and have our dog with us within eyesight of the beach.",Beautiful person-and-dog friendly beach so the whole family can play in the water together,2018,Douglas Park has a fabulous dog-and-person beach.

Meadow Lake,"Its was relaxing.    I do believe that if boats don't fit in your camp site, it should be made to be parked at the trailer parking area. People should not be able to park in the parking areas. There are way to many people parking vehicle all ready. for boats to be taking parking spots.",,2018,The park does a wonderful job.

Great Blue,Weather and the beach area,Pull through sites for larger trailers,2018,It is becoming very difficult to make a site specific reservation on line to suit the size of your trailer. Also it is difficult to get larger trailers into some of the sites due to the angle of the site entrance and the established traffic direction of the road way.

Meadow Lake,It met my expectations,Marina,2018,The online reservations works so much better with the staggered release dates.  I know it has been a few years but it is way better.  My only recommendation would be to limit the number of reservation during a specific time period to one.  Too many people are tying up multiple sites and then releasing later and paying the penalty.  Several of our friends have decided to go elsewhere when they aren't able to get a site instead of waiting to see if any sites get release by people whom booked more than one.  I

Can certainly say that some are better maintained and in better shape than others.  The reserve a site program needs to be better. I understand from a revenue perspective parks do not care if someone is physically occupying a site as long as it has been paid for, but as a client of parks it is very frustrating when you are trying to book a site.  We have had instances where we have booked what appeared in the system as the last site available, get to the campground a"

Blackstrap Provincial,"The service center in our campground area was absolutely filthy. There were so many dead mosquitoes all over the sinks and floors. It was too small (only one toilet and one shower). One of the faucets didn't even work. It took FOREVER for someone come and restock the toilet paper.

Most Trailers have the sewer in the middle... so ours would not reach... poorly planned and executed.,,2018,
Duck Mountain,Good service people,Alcohol free camping bays for people who prefer a quieter safer experience,2018,
Duck Mountain,The number of campsites with campers and tents set up but nobody there. It's disgusting that people basically own a piece of the park all summer prohibiting others who cannot book a seasonal site from bookibg the days they would like. I disagree with the huge number of seasonal sites allotted,,2018,Too many noisy dogs.

We do find it hard to have the families together in one campground when we register.  We would appreciate that being able to happen.  We enjoy Saskatchewan Landing as it is central for all the family members and the water is fun for the families.  We have been happy with the staff and for the most part the sites, except for last year, our site was not the best, being on  the side of the road."
Duck Mountain,Nothing was unsatisfactory,,2018,"We were not made aware of a fire ban at Douglas when we booked online. Fortunately, it was lifted the day we arrived. We would have been very disappointed if it had not and would have probably not stayed for the entire time booked.  This information should have been provided on the online reservation site."
Danielson,Having to keep moving from one campsite to another,,2018,I feel that Sask. residence should have the oppurtunity to book camping sites before out of province people do and if the site is paid for and is empty there should by a fine applied to the site.  That would prevent people booking and not showing up freeing up the site for sask residents to enjoy camping in their own province.

It was great to have that convince for something we may have forgotten to bring plus Ice to keep our food cold and bait for fishing.
Narrow Hills,We had a very unlevel site.  We could literally walk under the 5th wheel hitch it was so high in the air to make it level.,,2018,"We have two dogs that  we walked them multiple times a day and picked up after them.  Even tho we were told repeatedly via online registration, and at check in, about keeping them on a leash or locked  up at all times, many campsites allow their dogs lose and they would come rushing out to the road and come face to face with ours.  It got  fairly aggressive at times.   That rule is not enforced at all."

Duck Mountain,"Campsites were small, boat launch was closed, bear in the area.",,2018,"Just a note for Sask Landing, as we camped there as well. The power box in group camping could not support the minimum number of campers required to use the site. Not sure why or if that could be upgraded. Also, it was quite a long walk to the washroom and no showers on that side. Otherwise, it was great!"
Moose Mountain,The sites say they will fit a bigger trailer but are very small and narrow. The gravel is at the front of the site so to park properly you are not even on the gravel.,The Online Booking system should be 90 days in advance.  not the whole camping season on 1 day,2018,
Danielson,Love the park.,,2018,Park stay was great. Don't like the reservation system very much.
22,The geese are destroying the beach.    The store was not open on a weekend.,We really enjoy going to Prince Albert National Park. They have a llot more to offer.,2018,
Candle Lake,Water pressure sucked at the pumping station,,2018,
Buffalo Pound,I booked early online and chose a campsite close to the lake. Amenities were sufficient but a public shower facility would be appreciated by all. Beach area was clean. Flies and mosquitos were awful in late June but you can't do much about that. We will very likely return to the same campground.,public shower and/or laundry,2018,I wish it was summer all year so we could camp in Saskatchwan Parks any time.
Pike Lake,Limited stock at store.,"Continue to provide firewood, but consider a fire permit fee that goes directly to park maintenance.",2018,
Lac La,yes,,2018,no
Candle Lake,"On this particular occasion, the park staff did not notify us of any programs that were taking place during our stay. We found out from the volunteer campground host, when we learned we had missed many of them already. There was also a boil water advisory in place that we were unaware of due to lack of appropriate signage, and my children and I continued to drink the water for several days until we noticed the signage (despite leaving & re-entering the park several times; there was no signage at the main en",Cell phone tower or booster,2018,Your interpretive programs are wonderful. Please tell people about them!! We used to receive a calendar of events upon check-in but had to come back and ask for one this year. There were also no posters or calendars of events on the bulletin boards.
Makwa,Quiet peaceful not crowded,,2018,
Duck Mountain,There seems to be a lot of dog poop not picked up. Fishing licenses are expensive for out of province people.,More water stands,2018,Enjoyed it. Road repairs would be a big plus
Moose Mountain,Construction was to be happening but very little being done  second time the construction was to have been complete and again not. This could have been handled much better provincially. And because we camped in a baseball field that was repurposed to a campsite there was no fee reduction and no services to even dispose of garbage due to lack of accessing bins,,2018,"2018 was a bust at Kimball Lake. The construction Timing should have been handled much better. No access to day use, washrooms/showers, garbage bins was not good!  Construction workers were respectful but this should have been done either before or after opening the park. Donâ€™t know how this endeavour is even sustainable business related. Been attending for more than 35 years and considering going somewhere else because of the last two years"
Battlefords,We had no fire bans while were there so that was great considering this past summer. Noise level was very low. Lots of empty trailers though that is somewhat concerning during the week. Our kids and us were able to camp next to each other so that was great too.,Better beach area on east side of highway.,2018,
Battlefords,The bathrooms are disgusting!!! It should take more than 5 minutes to clean. There also needs to be more garbage bins around the park.,,2018,Every year we comment on the bathrooms! It would be nice if they actually cleaned them and fixed them up this season.
Lac La,We enjoy Greenwater lake because we also visited t family and friends there.,,2018,No
Danielson,Park is very nice and clean. There were many things to do since we were camping with our daughters and their families.,,2018,
Danielson,"We have been hosts for five years, camped here for  40+ years and know the staff well.",,2018,"Unattended dogs, dogs, dogs  The reason I am concerned about cannibus use in the campground is that people are very relaxed when they go camping and leave everything out thereby incurring extra risk for park animals and children to ingest cannibus. The park animals are already exposed to far too much human food and cigarette stubs. We don't want them sick and high. On the other hand the cannibus might cure the other human incurred illnesses. I see potential for a new study lol"
Duck Mountain,Not very well maintained,,2018,Saskatchewan residents should have opportunity to access registration services before out of province residents.
Lac La,Very nive camp ground but the weather was terrible,,2018,
Good Spirit,"We were often overwhelmed by the stink of marijuana from a nearby campsite, and the site we were in was extremely uneven.",,2018,"With the new cannabis regulations coming into effect, you need to mark VERY CLEAR where it will, and will not be permitted, AND STRICTLY ENFORCE IT for the comfort of visitors who are sickened by the offensive odour. You already seem to have an enforcement problem when it was illegal, and I don't see that improving by adding a few signs. I will be looking for campgrounds that offer  Cannabis free  campsite areas."
Crooked Lake,"1 I am not a hater of animals but Its not fair to people that donâ€™t like listening to some dogs bark all day when I pay the same amount of money as everyone else. There shouldnâ€™t be any dogs allowed    2. The boat launch at candle lake is horrible. Only one paved ramp the othe is sand  trucks lined up 6 or 7 deep to try and get boat in or out  Doesnâ€™t come close to some other parks for launching. Ex. Greenwater,  Emma   The amount of money the parks are making off people there is no need for these poo",Better boat launches and stores in the park,2018,Will not be returning any time soon to candle lake provincial park. Greenwater good spirit. Makwa. Are the best parks and set up properly
Great Blue,"Public bathrooms(outhouses) were disgusting to have to use. They are not vented and trap the methane gas inside. Made me vomit, get headaches but had no other choice if a sediment was forthcoming. Used better at regional parks. Even north in Woody,Isbister lakes have better facilities. I do not understand how a provincial park could even pass regulations on those. I am tempted to have a TV news team go to the surrounding parks and verify my complaint",Vented restrooms in this one,2018,No. Just please follow up on my comments as I cannot emphasize enough about the restroom facilities and the amount of money and campers that stay there should be proposed in its upgrade budget. I am not asking for running water to each but a vent pipe behind the toilet to the roof to vent out smells and gases.
22,Great facility and recreational activities. The park was clean and quiet at night. When the wind storm hit other campers came to check on us.,Gravel is great for RV campers. Sand and or mulch would make for better ground bedding and indicate clearly where  to set up a tent for tenting only campsites.,2018,"I am somewhat neutral on the Cannabis legalization and use in parks. The only thing I have to really say is that alcohol is allowed, tobacco is allowed, cannabis should not be treated any differently. and Edibles are not yet legal so they cannot be allowed at this time."
Duck Mountain,Everything went well during stay,,2018,
Duck Mountain,"We didnâ€™t like our site.  It was almost 38 degree the week we were there and out site had no shelter/coverage.  We love the park though, beaches and food area though.",Full service,2018,
Douglas Provincial,Various services,,2018,n0
Danielson,"We always enjoy our trips to Cypress, but some of the campsites are too close together in Rainbow and offer no privacy from the people next door to us, we are practically sitting together with strangers.  The firepits in particular are sometimes situated nearly in the site next to you.  Other than that, we love the park, it's beautiful and there is so much to do.",,2018,
Moose Mountain,Needed to call about downed tree branches at the beginning of the season,,2018,We did activities at Greg lake this year and they were very good.  Gate attendants promoted activities appropriate our kids ages
Candle Lake,"Pool closed,",Pool/Water slide and golf coarse,2018,Get the pool upgraded as the lake can be green a lot and no water activities allowed
Good Spirit,it was good,,2018,nope
Moose Mountain,We have camped at Kimbal lake for many many years and we only come for a very short time now.  The reservation system has completely destroyed our ability to stay the entire summer with many friends like we used to.  Before the lake was fully reserve only there were approximately 13 families that spent the entire summer there.  Now we stay maybe 1 week a year because the family atmosphere and the experience we loved has been ruined.  Yet there are empty sites everywhere while the system says the grounds are,Atleast a partial selection of sites that are first come first served,2018,"while the reservation system is not difficult to use i thoroughly dislike it.  Gate staff no longer know their customers, have very little interaction with their customers, and therefore do not care.  The quality of the store at kimball lake has declined severely in the last several years.  The hours are greatly reduced and the product selection is non existent after august long weekend.  The owner is not friendly and has no desire to please customers."
Crooked Lake,It is just so difficult to book for the dates you want. The stay itself was great.,,2018,
Buffalo Pound,"beautiful lake. Site was good, upper toilet at peck lake was really smelly in spite of being vacuumed.",All sites at peck on the lake seemed to be booked but no one ever arrived at their sites. meantime we are up on top.,2018,love Saskatcewan. love the park staff on phone. always kind and helpful.
Danielson,Would have preferred a site with all services.,,2018,Have camped in Cypress Park for more than 10 years. Health allowing will probably continue.
Saskatchewan Landing,We could not use a mini fridge outside our camper,,2018,"Illogical that we could not run a small mini fridge outside our unit,yet our neighbours whoâ€™s outdoor kitchen contained a LARGER fridge was ok. The fact that it is or isnâ€™t self contained should be irrelevant given that they draw the same amount of power."
Greenwater,The site we had reserved had been occupied by the building of a yurt. So we had to be in another campsite that was smaller and much more difficult to set up a tent in. When we arrived the site was full of big dog feces and we had to spend a great deal of time cleaning it up.,,2018,
Makwa,How I feel,,2018,
Cypress Hills,"no hassle check in,campsite was clean and easy to access.",,2018,"Good Parks,good people,good times."

Candle Lake,Distance to park  Fishing lake,Sure hope swimming pool returns,2018,Looking forward to checking out new dock at BPOUND
Lac La,"Clean, nice park.",Free Beer (just kidding),2018,
Duck Mountain,Tried to book online the day reservations opened and couldn't get a site to only find out numerous people have a group of people booking their sites they want for the days they want which makes the park look full when down the road they cancel their sites and only keep one that they really want so then we had to keep looking online for months waiting for a site to open up and because a site was only open for x amount of days we had to stay in the over flow prior to getting into our campsite we booked so we,,2018,
Meadow Lake,Fine,More full service sites,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,"We have been seasonal campers at Rowanâ€™s Ravine for 12 years in either seasonal sites or back to back maximum 14 day sites. Our campsite was extremely close to the campsite behind us on the other side of the loop. In fact the two trailers would be facing towards each other with no privacy. When we first stopped on the road to survey the site these campers were already expressing concerns that their group of four adults, 6 kids, 3 dogs and numerous visitors would be disturbing to us.and already were discus",Park activities and educational opportunities for families with young children.,2018,"We really hope this year is an outlier, but I worry that the neighbors we had this year will be just as unpleasant to be beside for their neighbors next year and this type of over use of one campsite should not be permitted. There needs to be a limit on the number of people sleeping on each site. There is also a foster parent that brings out a very large group of kids which Iâ€™d great, but they are allowed to take up a disabled site despite no vehicles displaying a disability permit and also to put up thre"
Narrow Hills,For us it is a matter of good location to do the recreational activities we enjoy. We actually try to camp in the less busier seasons because we like the quiet and peacefulness of that.,,2018,
Greenwater,Too many noisy campers every night & no one came around to tel them to shut up so I had to do it myself. CO's come around all day when everyone is at the beach or out on the water & then NEVER come around at night!!!!,,2018,
Duck Mountain,love the park and amenities.  We have been going to this park for 20+ years,some rentals for water activities would be nice,2018,
Danielson,We have always camped here it is a great place our only complaint is how you have to book on line and in early March ( I think ) some of us donâ€™t have great internet service and we canâ€™t get the site or time weâ€™d like,,2018,
Good Spirit,Pretty quiet most of the time,,2018,No
22,The camping area  was 2 different levels,,2018,I don't like the way you have to be standing by computer to get the weeks you want. For some us seniors we are not that computer savvy . Therefore if we make a a mistake we lose a spot we want. Tx.
Battlefords,because we always have a good stay.,,2018,
Duck Mountain,Had no issues and the campsite was great,,2018,Would be nice to see showers in the bathrooms other than the big ones
Danielson,We werenâ€™t very happy with the time that the pool was open. You already have enough staff and the pool isnâ€™t open long enough. You could easily leave the pool open for two extra hours daily!,,2018,
Saskatchewan Landing,"Our favorite SK park. Clean,beautiful sites with great facilities. Great fishing and very dog friendly. Friendly staff. Can't say enough great things. Still hope for a seasonal site.",Interpretive activies,2018,
Greenwater,"Daily visits by workers to give out activity information became quite bothersome.    Office was often open 10-15 late, in the morning.","Canoe, kayak, paddle board rentals",2018,"Far too much promotion of activities. Often having staff leave a flyer at campsite and approach people on foot a couple times a day, for several days leading up to the events. We go camping to relax, not be bothered by staff about events. The occasional event is fine but there are way too many unnecessary events taking up resources that would be better spent on roads inside the park, and maybe boat rentals (canoes, kayaks, paddle boards, etc)."
Candle Lake,Weather was good,Fully operational pool,2018,Get the pool operational in Buffalo Pound
Lac La,We really enjoy green water park. I am disappointed with the deteriorating roads. Other than that all was well.,,2018,We really enjoy our time at provincial parks and will continue to return each year.
Lac La,"The campsite was quite sloped but other than that it was a great stay.  Everything is in walking or bike riding distance.  Good private sites, nice beach area.  Great place for walking around and lots to do.",Riding Mountain National Park has gender neutral showers with doors on the outside of the building.  Way more efficient with availability of showers and less wait time for women.,2018,"At Greenwater, I had my park permit purchased online so when you come in the main gates, it's not clear where you go to check in for camping.  You have to go to the main office/centre but there is no sign that tells you that campsite registration is there.  I went to the campground area and then asked someone and had to circle back."
Crooked Lake,Water and garbage available to camping sites.,,2018,
Narrow Hills,Bathrooms were so dirty/ smelly  Wasp nests all over garbage disposals makes it tricky with allergies to get garbage to where it needs to go  Skunks are out of control,"booking system, and people who clean out fire pits regularly",2018,"We stayed there the entire summer and not once had anyone cut our grass or clean out fire pit. When a person pays that much a night, the regular maintenance of the empty sites that are providing no income to the parkâ€” should still apply to the sites that have people in them PAYING."
Douglas Provincial,We were satisfied with our choice of site but after checking out some of the others we would have prefered them.  The pictures online are deceiving!!,,2018,The Campgrounds from one area are clumped together on one date for booking.  It would be much easier if you had a Campground from different areas on each date.  If you are booking Douglas and Danielson you never get your sites you wanted for the second one by the time you get in to do so.
Meadow Lake,Camping space a little small   Need room to park a boat,,2018,Iâ€™m very unsatisfied with the main beach at the Battlefords provincial park. The beach was covered in goose droppings. I would be much happier if the geese where not allowed in the area
Battlefords,Just was,,2018,
Douglas Provincial,The weather was hot and dry when we were there and not a lot of shade in the campground.  Still lots ticks so walking anywhere other than on roadways was pretty much out of the question.  I realize that these factors are outside the control of park management.,,2018,no
Duck Mountain,Other than the water level in Lake Diefenbaker being really low I had no issues.,,2018,
Great Blue,Because you could do some improvements with the Balsam campground shower building!  Only 1 shower and 1 toilet in the building!,More showers and bathrooms in Balsam.  One bathroom and shower not enough in the current building.,2018,Just that in all the years our family has been coming to Good Spirit there have been no improvements to the roads driving into Good Spirit from Willowbrook and also that the shower/bathroom building has never been upgraded in the Balsam campground.  You would think in some many years there would be some improvement from the money that is generated from camp fees for the building at least.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!  One shower for Balsam is not acceptable!!
Douglas Provincial,There's nothing special there,,2018,"I was glad to see that danelson park hired a new maintenance boss and there was some things done there that hadn't been looked at for at least 4 to 6 years, the people before only knew how to drive around and around and also the wash rooms were kept cleaner.  I find its a conflict of interest to have a hotel owner looking after danelson and Douglas when he's going to do more in Douglas as that's where his business will come from not danelson."
Moose Mountain,The lake and beach is beautiful . The campsite was  sandy and rocky and uneven and not maintained.. Picked rocks and racked for 4 hours and cut grass in order to make site usable.,,2018,major bottle neck and congestion at the Kimball Lake camp ground. Check in office and the garbage containers and the wood supply and the only sewage dump are all in the same area with a single road way. And the only entry point into the campsites. This in my opinion is a safety hazard with a tragedy waiting to happen.
Moose Mountain,"campsites were nice, it was quiet, lots of activities to do, showers were good    store available",,2018,I would like to see better pictures of the camping site when reserving online
Lac La,"One thing I believe they should do is clean everyone's fire pit 1-2 times per week, not o my when people check out",,2018,"I believe the people who clean the bathroom should do a lot more....it seems like they just put a mop on the floor and quickly scrub the toilet.....there are always lots of cob webs and dead bugs on the wall they could quickly brush off(especially if they were to close the door and look)....but I do love the new lighting system in the bathrooms, but hate that they have way to much gravel on the paths between campsites, especially for smaller kids trying to ride their bikes.  Also, like I mentioned earlier."
22,We have camped there several times so know what to expect. The store is pathetic.,I would like to see New shower house in kimball lake they are disgusting,2018,The shower houses in Kimball Lake are absolutely disgusting they need to be replaced that is one of the busiest campgrounds with the most disgusting facilities.
Danielson,great just to get away from Regina and work to enjoy time with my son.,,2018,
Good Spirit,"Nice campground, one site was very close to the road could see everyone walking by people walking through",,2018,"The online booking fee is ridiculous, you should not have to pay if you book online you should get a deal. If you book over the phone you should have a fee. Just canâ€™t believe there is an online booking fee, when you are doing the booking yourself."
Battlefords,Some of our sites werenâ€™t the best. Lots of dead branches.,,2018,
Danielson,"As a group, we find it more and more difficult to reserve the one electrical group site. No one can seem to tell us exactly when we can reserve online as that information is not yet determined. The group cook-shack at the non electrical site is too small to fit our entire group in if the weather in inclement. Power at the cook shack would be a great bonus even if the sites are all non electrical.",,2018,"more group electrical sites would be nice, with a small shower facility on site would be even better."
Makwa,There were very noisy parties in the campground and no one came around to shut them down. I would have invited someone with mobility issues but this campground is not suitable for someone with mobility issues.,Reservation system for Nut Point Campground. Last year there was not many campers but this year very busy.,2018,"Campgrounds need to monitored for noisy, drunk campers and evicted as we pay to have a nice camping experience, not to be kept awake because of other campers."
Good Spirit,because i was,,2018,
Greenwater,yup,,2018,
Narrow Hills,There are only a few tent camping sites at the Park. The tenting area only had a small amount of shade and was quite open.  Most of the campsites are designed for campers and are gravel which you cannot tent on!!!!!!,More grassed tenting areas. You cannot set up a tent on gravel .,2018,
Crooked Lake,The site we had was very private and quiet..,If you book more than 30 days at one time there should be able to get a better campsite because the,2018,Campers who book more than 30 days should get early bookings over just the weekend campers who leave a lot of good sites vacant during the week.
Moose Mountain,"Yes, completely",,2018,Had another great year camping in Saskatchewan!! See you again next year!!
Lac La,"The roads had been repaired, there was better lighting in the campground toilets, the shower building in Hilltop campground was warm when it was cold outside, the campground was quiet at night, the skunk that I saw and smelled wasn't in my campsite.  There was a problem with the toilets in the campground being full and thus out of order and the outside light on the front of the shower building was not working which made it harder to see and more dangerous when vehicles were backing out.",,2018,I wondered if it would be possible  to cut some of the dead trees in the campground to use as firewood which would make the campsites safer and would provide better firewood. It would also be helpful if the logs were cut in smaller pieces as the way they were this year most of the wood was impossible for older people to cut. One younger couple told me they always bring their mechanical log splitter with them when they camp at Greenwater.
